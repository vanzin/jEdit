Mac OS Plugin 2.0

- Added MacOS menu to the Plugins menu. Provides time saving features
  like revealing files and folders in the Finder, and running
  AppleScripts.
- You can run AppleScripts (compiled, uncompiled and standalone).
  Scripts must be located in the scripts folder in the jEdit folder.
  They can be either plain text or compiled scripts. Scripts must have
  their type and creator set correctly, have a .scpt (for compiled
  scripts) or .applescript (for uncompiled scripts) extension, or
  both. Note: Scripts that require user interaction are not supported.
- Added and option to Mac OS Plugin settings to change the script
  folder search depth.
