 * Notes on use:
 *
 * An "include guard" is a conventional mechanism for reducing
 * compilation time for C/C++ source files by ensuring that the
 * substance of a header file is read by the preprocessor only once
 * for each compilation unit.  The usual reason this is necessary is
 * the presence of nested include files, sometimes an unavoidable
 * circumstance when creating a hierarchy of classes.
 *
 * To use the macro, first place the caret at the beginning of the header
 * file before any uncommented text.  The macro returns to this position
 * upon completion.
 *
 * The macro will complain if you have not yet named the buffer, but it
 * does not check to see if the buffer is actually a header file.
 *
 * The defined term that triggers the guard is taken from the buffer's
 * name. This is one conventional approach and should not cause a conflict
 * unless a compilation unit includes header files from different
 * directories with the same name.  In that case, change the conflicting
 * guard names manually.
