<part id="writing-macros-part"><title>Writing Macros</title>
 <partintro>

 <para>
  This part of the user's guide covers writing macros for jEdit.
 </para>

 <para>
  First, we will tell you a little about BeanShell,
  jEdit's macro scripting language. Next, we will walk through a few
  simple macros. We then present and analyze a dialog-based macro to
  illustrate additional macro writing techniques. Finally, we discuss
  several tips and techniques for writing and debugging macros.

<part id="writing-plugins-part"><title>Writing Plugins</title>
 <partintro>
  <para>
   This part of the user's guide covers writing plugins for jEdit.
  </para>

  <para>
   Like jEdit itself, plugins are written primarily in Java. While this
   guide assumes some working knowledge of the language, you are not
   required to be a Java wizard. If you can write a useful application of
   any size in Java, you can write a plugin.

<part id="api-guide-part"><title>jEdit API Reference</title>
 <partintro>
  <para>
   This part of the user's guide covers the jEdit <firstterm>application
   programmer interface</firstterm>. The information in this part is only useful
   to macro and plugin developers; you do not need to read it if you only want to
   use jEdit.
  </para>
  <para>
   The first two chapter covers BeanShell commands, which are can only
   be used in macros. The second chapter covers APIs useful to both macros and
   plugins.
   The final chapter covers the EditBus message system, which is typically
   only used by plugins.
