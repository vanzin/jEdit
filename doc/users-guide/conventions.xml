    <para>Several conventions are used throughout jEdit's user interface and

                    <entry>In many dialog boxes, the default button (it has a
                    heavy outline, or a special border, depending on the current
                    Swing look and feel) can be activated by pressing
                    <keycap>Enter</keycap>. Similarly, pressing
                    <keycap>Escape</keycap> will usually close a dialog
                    box.</entry>

                <row>
                    <entry><keycap>Alt</keycap>-key mnemonics</entry>

                    <entry>Some user interface elements (menus, menu items,
                    buttons) have a certain letter in their label underlined.
                    Pressing this letter in combination with the
                    <keycap>Alt</keycap> key activates the associated user
                    interface widget. The "F10" key can also be pressed to put
                    focus on the menu bar, it has the same functionality as the 
                    Alt key in Windows. Note that this functionality is not
                    available on MacOS X with the <quote>MacOS Adaptive</quote>
                    look and feel. See <xref linkend="appearance-pane" /> for
                    information on changing the look and feel.</entry>

                    <entry>Right mouse button</entry>

                    <entry>Used in jEdit to show context-sensitive menus. If you
                    have a one button Macintosh mouse, a
                    <keycap>Control</keycap>-click has the same effect.</entry>

                    <entry>Middle mouse button</entry>

                    <entry>Used by the quick copy feature (see <xref
                    linkend="quick-copy" />). True 3-button mice are rare these
                    days. If you have a wheel mouse, press down on the wheel
                    without rolling it. On a Macintosh with a one-button mouse,
                    <keycap>Option</keycap>-click. On other platforms without a
                    three-button mouse, <keycap>Alt</keycap>-click.</entry>
