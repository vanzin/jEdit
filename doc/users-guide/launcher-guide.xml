        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>The jEditLauncher package is a set of lightweight components for
        running jEdit under the Windows group of operating systems. The package
        is designed to run on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT
        (versions 4.0 and greater), Windows 2000 and Windows XP.</para>

        <para>While jEdit does not make available a component-type interface, it
        does contains an <quote>EditServer</quote> that listens on a socket for
        requests to load scripts written in the BeanShell scripting language.
        When the server activates, it writes the server port number and a
        pseudo-random, numeric authorization key to a text file. By default, the
        file is named <filename>server</filename> and is located in the settings
        directory (see <xref linkend="settings-directory" />).</para>

        <para>The jEditLauncher component locates and reads this file, opens a
        socket and attempts to connect to the indicated port. If successful, it
        transmits the appropriate BeanShell script to the server. If
        unsuccessful, it attempts to start jEdit and repeats the socket
        transmission once it can obtain the port and key information. The
        component will abandon the effort to connect roughly twenty seconds
        after it launches the application.</para>

        <title>Starting jEdit</title>

        <para>The main component of the jEditLauncher package is a client
        application entitled <command>jedit.exe</command>. It may be executed
        either from either Windows Explorer, a shortcut icon or the command
        line. It uses the jEditLauncher COM component to open files in jEdit
        that are listed as command line parameters. It supports Windows and UNC
        file specifications as well as wild cards. If called without parameters,
        it will launch jEdit. If jEdit is already running<!--  and has an active
      EditServer -->, it will simply open a new, empty buffer.</para>

        <para><command>jedit.exe</command> supports five command-line options.
        Except for the <userinput>/1</userinput> option, if any of these options
        are invoked correctly, the application will not load files or execute
        jEdit.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The option <userinput>/h</userinput> causes a window to be
                displayed with a brief description of the application and its
                various options.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>The option <userinput>/p</userinput> will activate a
                dialog window displaying the command-line parameters to be used
                when calling jEdit. This option can also be triggered by
                selecting <guilabel>Set jEdit Parameters</guilabel> from the
                <guilabel>jEdit</guilabel> section of the Windows Programs menu,
                or by running the utility program
                <command>jedinit.exe</command></para>

                <para>Using the dialog, you can change parameters specifying the
                executable for the Java application loader (either
                <filename>java.exe</filename> or
                <filename>javaw.exe</filename>), the location of the jEdit

                <para>Before committing changes to the command line parameters,
                <command>jedit.exe</command> validates the paths for the Java

                complain if the paths are invalid. It will not validate command
                line options, but it will warn you if it finds the
                <userinput>-noserver</userinput> option used for jEdit, since
                this will deactivate the edit server and make it impossible for
                jEditLauncher to open files.</para>

                <para>Note that due to the design of
                <application>jEditLauncher</application>, platform-independent
                command line options handled by jEdit itself (such as
                <userinput>-background</userinput> and
                <userinput>-norestore</userinput>) must be entered in the
                <quote>Set jEdit Parameters</quote> dialog box, and cannot be
                specified on the <command>jedit.exe</command> command line
                directly. For information about platform-independent command
                line options, see <xref linkend="cli-usage" />.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>The option <userinput>/1</userinput> is intended for use
                in circumstances where a single file name is passed to jEdit for
                opening, and quotation marks cannot be used to delimit file
                names containing whitespace. The launcher reads the entire
                command line following the <userinput>/1</userinput> options as
                a single file path, regardless of the presence of whitespace,
                and passes the resulting string as a single file name parameter
                to jEdit.</para>

                <para>This option allows jEdit to be used with version 5 or
                greater of Internet Explorer as an alternate text editor or as
                the target of the <guimenuitem>View Source</guimenuitem>
                command. Included with the jEditLauncher distribution is a file
                named <filename>jEdit_IE.reg.txt</filename> containing an
                example of a Window registry file that you can use to register
                jEdit as a HTML editor with Internet Explorer. Instructions for
                the file's use are included in the text.</para>

                <para>The use of the <userinput>/1</userinput> option with
                multiple file names or other parameters will lead to program
                errors or unpredictable results.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>The option <userinput>/i</userinput> is not mentioned in
                the help window for <filename>jedit.exe</filename>. It is
                intended primarily to be used in conjunction with jEdit's Java
                installer, but it can also be used to install or reinstall
                jEditLauncher manually. When accompanied by a second parameter
                specifying the directory where your preferred Java interpreter
                is located, jEditLauncher will install itself and set a
                reasonable initial set of command line parameters for executing
                jEdit. You can change these parameters later by running
                <filename>jedinit.exe</filename> or
                <filename>jedit.exe</filename> with the<userinput>/p</userinput>
                option.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>The option <userinput>/u</userinput> will cause
                jEditLauncher to be uninstalled by removing its registry
                entries. This option does not delete any jEditLauncher or jEdit
                files.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="launcher-menu">
        <title>The Context Menu Handler</title>

        <para>The jEditLauncher package also implements a context menu handler
        for the Windows shell. It is intended to be be installed as a handler
        available for any file. When you right-click on a file or shortcut icon,
        the context menu that appears will include an item displaying the jEdit
        icon and captioned <guilabel>Open with jEdit</guilabel>. If the file has
        an extension, another item will appear captioned <guilabel>Open *.XXX
        with jEdit</guilabel>, where XXX is the extension of the selected file.
        Clicking this item will cause jEdit to load all files with the same
        extension in the same directory as the selected file. Multiple file
        selections are also supported; in this circumstance only the
        <guilabel>Open with jEdit</guilabel> item appears.</para>

        <para>If a single file with a <filename>.bsh</filename> extension is
        selected, the menu will also contain an item captioned <guilabel>Run
        script in jEdit</guilabel>. Selecting this item will cause jEditLauncher
        to run the selected file as a BeanShell script.</para>

        <para>If exactly two files are selected, the menu will contain an entry
        for <guilabel>Show diff in jEdit</guilabel>. Selecting this item will
        load the two files in jEdit and have them displayed side-by-side with
        their differences highlighted by the <application>JDiff</application>
        plugin. The file selected first will be treated as the base for
        comparison purposes. If the plugin is not installed, an error message
        will be displayed in jEdit. See <xref linkend="using-plugins" /> for
        more information about installing plugins.</para>

    <section id="launcher-jedidiff">
        <title>Using jEdit and jEditLauncher as a Diff Utility</title>

        <para>As noted above, you can create a graphical diff display comparing
        the contents of two text files by selecting the two files in an Explorer
        window, right-clicking to produce a context menu, and selecting the
        <guimenuitem>Show diff in jEdit</guimenuitem> menu item. The utility
        <filename>jedidiff.exe</filename> allows you to perform this operation
        from a command line. The command takes the two files to be compared as
        parameters; they should be delimited by quotation marks if their paths
        contain whitespace.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="launcher-uninstall">
        <title>Uninstalling jEdit and jEditLauncher</title>

        <para></para>

        <para>There are three ways to uninstall jEdit and jEditLauncher.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>First, you can run <filename>unlaunch.exe</filename> in
                the jEdit installation directory.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>Second, you can choose <guilabel>Uninstall
                jEdit</guilabel> from the <guilabel>jEdit</guilabel> section of
                the Programs menu. <!-- This will
        uninstall the <quote>primary</quote> version of jEdit (and will
        designate a new primary version if any versions remain). --></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>Third, you can choose the uninstall option for jEdit in
                the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs applet. <!-- This allows you to specify
        unambiguously the version of jEdit that you wish to remove. --></para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Each of these options will deactivate jEditLauncher and delete all
        files in jEdit's installation directory. As a safeguard, jEditLauncher
        displays a warning window and requires the user to confirm an uninstall
        operation. Because the user's settings directory can be set and changed
        from one jEdit session to another, user settings files must be deleted
        manually.</para>

        <para>To deactivate jEditLauncher without deleting any files, run
        <filename>jedit /u</filename> from any command prompt where the jEdit
        installation directory is in the search path. This will remove the
        entries for jEditLauncher from the Windows registry. It will also
        disable the context menu handler and the automatic launching and
        scripting capabilities. The package can reactivated by executing
        <command>jedit.exe</command> again, and jEdit can be started in the same
        manner as any other Java application on your system.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="launcher-interface">
        <title>The jEditLauncher Interface</title>

        <para>The core of the jEditLauncher package is a COM component that can
        communicate with the EditServer, or open jEdit if it is not running or
        is otherwise refusing a connection. The component supports both Windows
        and UNC file specifications, including wild cards. It will resolve
        shortcut links to identify and transmit the name of the underlying
        file.</para>

        <para>Because it is implemented with a <quote>dual interface</quote>,
        the functions of jEditLauncher are available to scripting languages in
        the Windows environment such as VBScript, JScript, Perl (using the
        Win32::OLE package) and Python (using the win32com.client
        package).</para>

        <para>The scriptable interface consists of two read-only properties and
        six functions:</para>

        <para><emphasis>Properties</emphasis></para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><varname>ServerPort</varname> - a read-only property that
                returns the port number found in jEdit's server file; the value
                is not tested for authenticity. It returns zero if the server
                information file cannot be located.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><varname>ServerKey</varname> - a read-only property that
                returns the numeric authorization key found in jEdit's server
                file; the value is not tested for authenticity. It returns zero
                if the server information file cannot be located.</para>
            </listitem>

        <para><emphasis>Functions</emphasis></para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><function>OpenFile</function> - a method that takes a

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><function>OpenFiles</function> - this method takes an
                array of file names (with or without wild card characters) as a
                parameter. The form of the array is that which is used for
                arrays in the scripting environment. In JScript, for example the
                data type of the <classname>VARIANT</classname> holding the
                array is <classname>VT_DISPATCH</classname>; in VBScript, it is
                <classname>VT_ARRAY | VT_VARIANT</classname>, with array members
                having data type <classname>VT_BSTR</classname>.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><function>Launch</function> - this method with no
                parameters attempts to open jEdit without loading additional
                files.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><function>RunScript</function> - this method takes a file
                name or full file path as a parameter and runs the referenced
                file as a BeanShell script in jEdit. The predefined variables
                <varname>view</varname>, <varname>editPane</varname>,
                <varname>textArea</varname> and <varname>buffer</varname> are
                available to the script. If more than one view is open, the
                variable are initialized with reference to the earliest opened
                view. If no path is given for the file it will use the working
                directory of the calling process.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><function>EvalScript</function> - this method takes a
                string as a parameter containing one or more BeanShell
                statements and runs the script in jEdit's BeanShell interpreter.
                The predefined variables are available on the same basis as in

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><function>RunDiff</function> - this method takes two
                strings representing file names as parameters. If the
                <application>JDiff</application> plugin is installed, this
                method will activate the JDiff plugin and display the two files
                in the plugin's graphical <quote>dual diff</quote> format. The
                first parameter is treated as the base for display purposes. If
                the <application>JDiff</application> plugin is not installed, a
                error message box will be displayed in jEdit.</para>

        <title>Scripting Examples</title>

        <para>Here are some brief examples of scripts using jEditLauncher. The
        first two will run under Windows Script Host, which is either installed
        or available for download for 32-bit Windows operating systems. The next
        example is written in Perl and requires the Win32::OLE package. The last
        is written in Python and requires the win32gui and win32com.client
        extensions.</para>

        <para>If Windows Script Host is installed, you can run the first two
        scripts by typing the name of the file containing the script at a

        <title>jEditLauncher Logging</title>

        <para>The jEditLauncher package has a logging facility that is separate
        from jEdit's Activity Log to provide a record of events occurring
        outside the Java virtual machine environment in which jEdit operates.
        The logging facility maintains two log files:
        <filename>jelaunch.log</filename> for events relating to starting jEdit,
        loading files and running scripts, and <filename>install.log</filename>
        for jEditLauncher installation activity. Both files are maintained in
        the directory in which jEdit is installed. They are cumulative from
        session to session, but may be manually deleted at any time without
        affecting program execution.</para>

    <!-- <section id="launcher-install"><title>Standalone Installation</title>
    <para>
      Installation of jEditLauncher occurs as part of the installation of the
      jEdit package for Windows. If a full jEdit installation fails, you can
      install jEditLauncher by placing the following files in the same
      directory as <filename>jedit.jar</filename>, the archive containing the
      Java application:

    <para>
      Anytime <filename>jedit.exe</filename> is executed (either directly or
      indirectly through a call to <filename>jedinit.exe</filename>),
      jEditLauncher checks to see if it is properly installed. If it is not,
      it will offer to install itself. If you agree, you will then be asked to
      supply the path to a Java interpreter. The directory you choose should
      contain <filename>javaw.exe</filename>, which the installer uses as a
      default; you can change the interpreter later with a call to
      <filename>jedinit.exe</filename>.
