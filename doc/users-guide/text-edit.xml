 <sect1 id="caret"><title>Moving The Caret</title>
  <para>
   The simplest way to move the caret is to click the
   mouse at the desired location in the text area. The caret can also be moved
   using the keyboard.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <keycap>Left</keycap>, <keycap>Right</keycap>, <keycap>Up</keycap> and
   <keycap>Down</keycap> keys move the caret in the respective direction, and
   the <keycap>Page Up</keycap> and <keycap>Page Down</keycap> keys move the
   caret up and down one screenful, respectively.
  </para>
  <para>
   When pressed once, the <keycap>Home</keycap> key moves the caret to the first
   non-whitespace character of the current line. Pressing it a second time
   moves the caret to the beginning of the current line. Pressing it a third time
   moves the caret to the first visible line.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <keycap>End</keycap> key behaves in a
   similar manner, going to the last non-whitespace character, the end of
   the line, and finally to the last visible line.
  </para>
  <para>
   If there is a selection, <keycap>Home</keycap> and <keycap>End</keycap>
   behave the same as above, except that instead of operating on the current
   line, they move the caret to the first and last lines of the selection,
   respectively.
  </para>
  <para>
   If soft wrap is enabled (see <xref linkend="word-wrap"/>), the first time
   they are pressed
   <keycap>Home</keycap> and <keycap>End</keycap> only go to the start and end
   of the current screen line; the second press moves to the start and end of
   the physical line.
  </para>
  <para>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Home</keycap></keycombo> and
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>End</keycap></keycombo> move the
   caret to the beginning and end of the buffer.
  </para>
  <para>
   More advanced caret movement is covered in
   <xref linkend="words" />, <xref linkend="lines" /> and
   <xref linkend="paragraphs" />.
  </para>
  <sidebar><title>The Home and End keys</title>
   <para>
    If you prefer more traditional behavior for the
    <keycap>Home</keycap> and <keycap>End</keycap> keys, you can reassign
    the respective keyboard shortcuts in the <guibutton>Shortcuts</guibutton>
    pane of the
    <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>.
   </para>
   <para>
    By default, the shortcuts are assigned as follows:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para><keycap>Home</keycap> is bound to <guimenuitem>Smart
    Home</guimenuitem>.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><keycap>End</keycap> is bound to <guimenuitem>Smart
    End</guimenuitem>.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>Home</keycap>
    </keycombo> is bound to <guimenuitem>Select to Smart
    Home Position</guimenuitem>.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>End</keycap>
    </keycombo> is bound to <guimenuitem>Select to Smart
    End Position</guimenuitem>.</para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    However you can rebind them to any set of other commands, such as:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para><guimenuitem>Go to Start of White Space</guimenuitem>,</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><para><guimenuitem>Go to End of White Space</guimenuitem>,</para>

 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="selection"><title>Selecting Text</title>
  <para>
   A <firstterm>selection</firstterm> is a a block of text marked for further
   manipulation. jEdit supports both
   range and rectangular selections, and several chunks of text can be
   selected simultaneously.
  </para>
  <para>
   Dragging the mouse creates a range selection from where the mouse was
   pressed to where it was released.
   Holding down <keycap>Shift</keycap> while clicking a location in the
   buffer will create a selection from the caret position to the clicked
   location.
  </para>
  <para>
   Holding down <keycap>Shift</keycap> in addition to a caret movement key
   (<keycap>Left</keycap>, <keycap>Up</keycap>, <keycap>Home</keycap>, etc) will
   extend a selection in the specified direction.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Select All</guimenuitem> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo>) selects the
   entire buffer.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Select None</guimenuitem> (shortcut:
   <keycap>Escape</keycap>) deactivates the selection.
  </para>
  <sect2 id="rect-select"><title>Rectangular Selection</title>
   <para>
    Dragging with the <keycap>Control</keycap> key held down will create a
    rectangular selection. Holding down
    <keycap>Shift</keycap> and <keycap>Control</keycap> while clicking a
    location in the buffer will create a rectangular selection from the caret
    position to the clicked location.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is possible to select a rectangle with zero width but non-zero height.
    This can be used to insert a new column between two existing
    columns, for example. Such zero-width selections are shown as a thin
    vertical line.
   </para>
   <para>
    Rectangles can be deleted, copied, pasted, and operated on using ordinary
    editing commands.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     Rectangular selections are implemented using character offsets,
     not absolute screen positions, so they might not behave as you might
     expect if a proportional-width font is being used or if soft wrap is
     enabled. The text area font can be changed in the
     <guibutton>Text Area</guibutton> pane of the
     <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
     dialog box. For information about soft wrap,
     see <xref linkend="word-wrap" />.
    </para>
   </note>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="multi-select"><title>Multiple Selection</title>
   <para>
    Pressing <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>\</keycap></keycombo>
    turns multiple selection mode on and
    off. In multiple selection mode, multiple fragments of text can be selected
    and operated on simultaneously, and the caret can be moved independently
    of the selection. The status bar indicates if multiple
    selection mode is active; see <xref linkend="status-bar"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Various jEdit commands behave differently with multiple selections:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Commands that copy text place the contents of
    each selection, separated by line breaks, in the specified register.
    </para></listitem>

    Tabs</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Range Comment</guimenuitem>,
    <guimenuitem>Replace in Selection</guimenuitem>, and so on) behave as if
    each block was selected independently, and the command invoked on each in
    turn.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Line-based commands (such as <guimenuitem>Shift Indent
    Left</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Shift Indent Right</guimenuitem>, and
    <guimenuitem>Line Comment</guimenuitem>) operate on each line that contains
    at least one selection.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Caret movement commands that would normally deactivate the
    selection (such as the arrow keys, while <keycap>Shift</keycap> is not being
    held down), move the caret, leaving the selection as-is.</para></listitem>

    (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
    <keycap>I</keycap>) selects a set of text chunks such that all text
    that was formerly part of a selection is now unselected, and all text that
    wasn't, is selected.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     Deactivating multiple selection
     mode while multiple blocks of text are selected will leave the selections
     in place, but you will not be able to add new selections until
     multiple selection mode is reactivated.
    </para>
   </note>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="entering-text"><title>Inserting and Deleting Text</title>
  <para>
   Text entered at the keyboard is inserted into the buffer. If
   overwrite mode is on, one character is deleted from in
   front of the caret position for every character that is inserted.
   To activate overwrite mode, press <keycap>Insert</keycap>. The caret is
   drawn as horizontal line while in overwrite
   mode. The status bar also indicates if overwrite mode is active; see
   <xref linkend="status-bar"/> for details.
  </para>
  <para>
   Inserting text while there is a selection will replace the selection
   with the inserted text.
  </para>
  <para>
   When inserting text, keep in mind that the <keycap>Tab</keycap> and
   <keycap>Enter</keycap> keys might
   not behave entirely like you expect because  of various indentation
   features; see <xref linkend="indent" /> for details.
  </para>
  <para>
   The simplest way to delete text is with the
   <keycap>Backspace</keycap> and <keycap>Delete</keycap> keys. If nothing is
   selected, they delete the character before or after the caret,
   respectively. If a selection exists, both delete the
   selection.
  </para>
  <para>
   More advanced deletion commands are described in
   <xref linkend="words" />, <xref linkend="lines" /> and
   <xref linkend="paragraphs" />.

  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>) reverses the
   most recent editing command. For example, this can be
   used to restore unintentionally deleted text. More complicated operations,
   such as a search and replace, can also be undone. By default, information
   about the last 100 edits is retained; older edits cannot be undone.
   The maximum number of undos can be changed in the <guibutton>Editing</guibutton> pane
   of the <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global
   Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.
  </para>

   <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Redo</guimenuitem> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo>) can restore
   the changes again. For example, if some
   text was inserted, <guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem> will remove it from the
   buffer. <guimenuitem>Redo</guimenuitem> will insert it again.

  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Complete Word</guimenuitem> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>B</keycap></keycombo>) locates
   possible completions for the word at the caret, first by looking in the
   current edit mode's syntax highlighting
   keyword list, and then in the current buffer for words that begin with the
   word at the caret.
  </para>
  <para>
   If there is only one completion, it will be inserted into the buffer
   immediately.
   If multiple completions were found, they will be listed in a popup below
   the caret position. To insert a completion from the list, either click it
   with the mouse,
   or select it using the <keycap>Up</keycap> and <keycap>Down</keycap> keys and
   press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. To close the popup without inserting a
   completion, press <keycap>Escape</keycap>. Typing while the popup is
   visible will automatically update the popup and narrow the set of
   completions as necessary.

   </para>
   <para>
    Note that since jEdit only scrolls one whole <quote>physical</quote>
    (newline-delimited) line

  <para>
   jEdit provides a rich set of commands for moving and copying text. Commands
   are provided for moving chunks of text from buffers to
   <firstterm>registers</firstterm> and vice-versa. A register is a holding area
   for an arbitriary length of text, with a single-character name.
   The system clipboard is mapped to the register named <filename>$</filename>.
   jEdit offers clipboard-manipulation commands similar
   to those found in other applications, in addition to a more flexible
   set of commands for working with registers directly.

   <filename><replaceable>filename</replaceable></filename> is the file
   name. (The dot prefix
   makes the markers file hidden on Unix systems.) Marker

    If text was selected in the text area and the selection
    does not span a line break, the selected text becomes the default search

    If the selection spans a line break, the
    <guibutton>Search in Selection</guibutton>

   </para>
   <para>
    Selecting the <guibutton>Ignore
    case</guibutton> check box makes the search case insensitive -
    for example, searching for

    and <quote>HeLlO</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Selecting the <guibutton>Regular expressions</guibutton> check
    box allows a regular expression to be used in the search string. Regular
    expressions can
    match inexact sequences of text that optionally span more than one line.
    Regular expression syntax is described in
    <xref linkend="regexps" />.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <guibutton>Backward</guibutton> and <guibutton>Forward</guibutton>

   </para>
   <para>
    Clicking <guibutton>Find</guibutton> will locate the next occurrence of
    the search string (or previous occurrence, if

    will remain open after the search string has been located; otherwise,
    it will close.

    If no occurrences could be found and the
    <guibutton>Auto wrap</guibutton> check box is selected, the search will
    automatically restart from the beginning of the buffer (or the end, if

    see <xref linkend="history" /> for details.
   </para>
   <para>
    Clicking <guibutton>Replace &amp; Find</guibutton> will perform a
    replacement in the current selection and locate the next occurrence of the
    search string. Clicking <guibutton>Replace All</guibutton> will replace all
    occurrences of the search string with the replacement string in the current
    search scope (which is either the selection, the current buffer, or a set of
    buffers, as specified in the search and replace dialog box).
   </para>
   <para>
    Occurrences of the search string can be replaced with either a replacement
    string, or the return value of a BeanShell script snippet. Two radio buttons
    in the search and replace dialog box select between the two replacement
    modes, which are described in detail below.
   </para>
   <sect3><title>Text Replace</title>
    <para>
     If the <guibutton>Text</guibutton> button is selected,
     the search string is simply replaced with the replacement
     string.

    <para>
     If regular expressions are enabled, positional parameters
     (<literal>$0</literal>, <literal>$1</literal>, <literal>$2</literal>, and so

     replacement string; see <xref linkend="regexps" /> for more information.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the search is case-insensitive, jEdit attempts to modify the
     case of the replacement string to match that of the particular instance
     of the search string being replaced. For example, searching
     for <quote>label</quote> and replacing it with <quote>text</quote>, will
     perform the following replacements:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para><quote>String label</quote> would become <quote>String text</quote>
     </para></listitem>
     <listitem><para><quote>setLabel</quote> would become <quote>setText</quote>

     <listitem><para><quote>DEFAULT_LABEL</quote> would become <quote>DEFAULT_TEXT</quote>
     </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </sect3>
   <sect3><title>BeanShell Replace</title>
    <para>
     In BeanShell replacement mode, the search string is replaced with the return
     value of a BeanShell snippet. The following predefined variables can be
     referenced in the snippet:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist><listitem><para><varname>_0</varname> -- the text to be
    replaced</para>
    </listitem><listitem><para><varname>_1</varname> - <varname>_9</varname> --
    if regular expressions are enabled, these contain the values of matched
    subexpressions.

    contained in the specified directory whose names match the glob will be
    searched. The
    directory to search in can either be entered in the
    <guibutton>Directory</guibutton> text field, or chosen in a file selector
    dialog box by clicking the <guibutton>Choose</guibutton> button next to
    the field.
    If the <guibutton>Search subdirectories</guibutton> check box is selected,
    all subdirectories of the specified directory will also be searched. Keep
    in mind that searching through directories containing many files can take
    a long time.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <guibutton>Directory</guibutton> and <guibutton>Filter</guibutton>
    text fields remember previously entered strings; see <xref linkend="history" />
    for details.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that clicking the <guibutton>All Buffers</guibutton> or
    <guibutton>Directory</guibutton> radio buttons also selects the
    <guibutton>HyperSearch</guibutton> check box
    since that is what you would want, most of the time.
    However, normal match-by-match searching is supported for multiple files as
    well.
   </para>
   <para>
    Two convenience commands are provided for performing multiple file searches.
   </para>
   <para>
    <guimenu>Search</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Search in Open
    Buffers</guimenuitem> (shortcut:
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>B</keycap></keycombo>) displays
    the search dialog box and selects the <guibutton>All
    buffers</guibutton> button.
   </para>
   <para>
    <guimenu>Search</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Search in Directory</guimenuitem>
    (shortcut:
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo>) displays
    the search dialog box and selects the
    <guibutton>Directory</guibutton> button.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="search-bar"><title>The Search Bar</title>
   <para>
    The search bar feature provides a convenient way to search in the current
    buffer without
    opening the search dialog box. The search bar does not support multiple file
    search or replacement.
    The search bar remembers
    previously entered strings; see <xref linkend="history" /> for details.
   </para>
   <para>
    By default, the search bar remains hidden until one of the quick search
    commands (described below) is invoked; however you can choose to have it
    always visible in the <guibutton>General</guibutton> pane of the
    <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
    dialog box.
   </para>
   <para>
    <guimenu>Search</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Incremental Search Bar</guimenuitem>
    (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>,</keycap></keycombo>)
    displays the search bar if necessary, and gives it keyboard focus.
    If this command is invoked while there is a selection, the selection is
    placed in the search string field.
   </para>
   <para>
    <guimenu>Search</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Incremental Search
    for Word</guimenuitem>
    (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>,</keycap></keycombo>)
    behaves like the above command except it places the word at the caret in
    the search string field.
   </para>
   <para>
    Unless the <guibutton>HyperSearch</guibutton> check box is selected, the
    search bar will perform an <firstterm>incremental search</firstterm>.
    In incremental search mode, the first occurrence of the search
    string is located in the current buffer as it is being typed.
    Pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap>
    and <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Enter</keycap></keycombo>
    searches for the next and previous occurrence, respectively.
    Once the desired occurrence has been located, pressing <keycap>Escape</keycap>
    returns keyboard focus to the text area. Unless the search bar is set to be
    always visible (see above), pressing <keycap>Escape</keycap> will also hide
    the search bar.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     Incremental searches cannot be not recorded in macros. If your macro
     needs to perform a search, use the
     search and replace dialog box instead. See <xref linkend="using-macros" />
     for information about macros.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    <guimenu>Search</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>HyperSearch Bar</guimenuitem>
    (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>.</keycap></keycombo>)
    displays the search bar if necessary, gives it keyboard focus,
    and selects the <guibutton>HyperSearch</guibutton> check box.
    If this command is invoked while there is a selection, the selected text
    will be searched for immediately and the search bar will not be shown.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the <guibutton>HyperSearch</guibutton> check box is
    selected, pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> in the search string field
    will perform a HyperSearch in the current buffer.
   </para>
   <para>
    <guimenu>Search</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>HyperSearch
    for Word</guimenuitem>
    (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>.</keycap></keycombo>)
    performs a HyperSearch for the word at the caret. This command does not
    show the search bar or give it keyboard focus.
   </para>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="repeat"><title>Command Repetition</title>
  <para>
   The final feature discussed in this chapter provides a way to repeat a command
   any number of times.
  </para>
  <para>
   To repeat a command multiple times, press
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Enter</keycap></keycombo>, enter the
   desired repeat count, then invoke the command to repeat (either using a
   keyboard shortcut, or by selecting it from the menu bar). For example,
   <quote><keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Enter</keycap></keycombo>
   <keycap>1</keycap> <keycap>4</keycap>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo></quote> will delete
   14 lines; <quote><keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Enter</keycap></keycombo>
   <keycap>9</keycap>
   <keycap>#</keycap></quote>
   will insert <quote>#########</quote> in the buffer.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you specify a repeat count greater than 20, a confirmation dialog box will
   be displayed, asking if you really want to perform the action. This prevents
   you from hanging jEdit by executing a command too many times.
