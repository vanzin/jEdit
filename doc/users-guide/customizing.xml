        <title>Buffer-Local Properties</title>

        <para>Buffer-local properties provide an alternate way to change editor
        settings on a per-buffer basis. While changes made in the
        <guimenuitem>Buffer Options</guimenuitem> dialog box are lost after the
        buffer is closed, buffer-local properties take effect each time the file
        is opened, because they are embedded in the file itself.</para>

        <para>When jEdit loads a file, it checks the first and last 10 lines for
        colon-enclosed name/value pairs. For example, placing the following in a
        buffer changes the indent width to 4 characters, enables soft tabs, and
        activates the Perl edit mode:</para>

        <screen>:indentSize=4:noTabs=true:mode=perl:</screen>

        <para>Adding buffer-local properties to a buffer takes effect after the
        next time the buffer is saved.</para>

        <para>The following table describes each buffer-local property in
        detail.</para>

        <para> You may see <literal>:encoding=XXX:</literal> in a file
        as it is a buffer-local property and specifying the character encoding
        for the file. But it is not really a buffer-local property, and behaves
        differently.
        It is detected by <literal>buffer-local-properties</literal> detector
        only if the detector is selected in encoding options. Thus, it works
        only at loading, and it must appear near the top of the file.

            <para>To change an abbreviation or its expansion, either
            double-click the appropriate table entry, or click a table entry and
            then click the <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button. This will display
            a dialog box for modifying the abbreviation.</para>

            <para>The <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button displays a dialog box
            where you can define a new abbreviation. The

            Others can be defined in plugins as services and added to this

            <para>The <literal>List of Fallback Encodings</literal> is used when
            a file fails to open in the default encoding, and the Encoding
            Autodetectors also fail. The list order here determines the order of
            encodings that are tried. Each is separated by a space. This is
            especially handy when doing directory searches through files of
            different encodings. We suggest using <literal>UTF-8</literal> as
            either your default or one of the fallback encodings.</para>

            <para>While jEdit allows you to edit files in a variety of different
            encodings, the average user switches between only 2 or 3. In other
            parts of jEdit, where the list of encodings is displayed in a
            combobox (such as the buffer options) or a menu (such as
            <guimenuitem>File - Reload with Encoding</guimenuitem> submenu) it
            may be desirable to display only a subset of available encodings,
            those that are in common local use. The Encodings checkbox list
            allows the user to select the subset of supported encodings to
            display in other GUI components that list all of the
            encodings.</para>

            <para> Some shortcuts, such as C+e, C+m, and C+r, are prefixes for two-keystroke shortcuts. Another  keystroke may be used as a prefix in a 2-key shortcut, so for example, C+x can be redefined as a prefix to make it more emacs-like, by mapping any other action to a C+x prefixed shortcut.</para>

            <para> Conversely, emacs users will notice at first that C+e can not be mapped as a single key shortcut to go to the end of the line, unless all of the other actions that contain C+e prefixed shortcuts are remapped to other shortcuts first. After that, C+e can be bound to end-of-line. </para>

    <section id="settings-directory">
        <title>The jEdit Settings Directory</title>

        <para>jEdit stores settings, macros, and plugins as files inside the
        <firstterm>settings directory</firstterm>. In most cases, editing these
        files by hand is not necessary, since graphical tools and editor
        commands can do the job. However, being familiar with the structure of
        the settings directory still comes in handy in certain situations, for
        example when you want to copy jEdit settings between computers.</para>

        <para>The location of the settings directory is system-specific; it is
        printed to the activity log
        (<guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Troubleshooting</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Activity
        Log</guimenuitem>). For example:</para>

        <screen>[message] jEdit: Settings directory is /home/slava/.jedit</screen>

        <para>Another way to find the location of your settings directory is to
        use the "Utilities" menu, then the "Settings Directory" menu item. The
        first item in the pullout menu is the location of your settings directory.
        </para>

        <para>Specifying the <userinput>-settings</userinput> switch on the
        command line instructs jEdit to store settings in a directory other than
        the default. For example, the following command will instruct jEdit to
        store all settings in the <filename>jedit</filename> subdirectory of the
        <filename>C:</filename> drive:</para>

        <screen><prompt>C:\jedit&gt;</prompt> <userinput>jedit -settings=C:\jedit</userinput></screen>

        <para>The <userinput>-nosettings</userinput> switch will force jEdit to
        not look for or create a settings directory; default settings will be
        used instead.</para>

        <!-- para>

            <para>The jEdit <literal>properties</literal> file uses the Java

            integer or boolean) by plugins at runtime.</para>

            <para>Do not edit this file while jEdit is running. If you do, it

            <title>Site Properties</title>
            <para>
                You may also put properties files in the "properties" directory in
                the jEdit home directory (NOT the .jedit settings directory). You
                can locate the jEdit home directory by going to the Utilities menu
                directory, then the "jEdit Home Directory" menu item, and the first
                item in the pullout menu will be the location of the jEdit home
                directory. This is intended for site-wide settings and it is
                useful for things like a set of custom key bindings that you might
                want to share between different computers. This lets you keep your
                custom properties separate from the jEdit properties, so they are
                easier to find, edit, and move between machines. Note that your
                custom properties files must have ".props" as the file name extension.
            </para>
            <para>
                Site properties files are read in alphabetically by file name. This means
                that if you have a property with the same name in more than one file,
                the value for that property will be the value found in the last file
                that was read.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can edit these files inside jEdit - changes made to these files will not be re-read until the next time jEdit is started.
