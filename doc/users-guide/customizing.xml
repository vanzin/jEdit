        <title>Buffer-Local Properties</title>

        <para>Buffer-local properties provide an alternate way to change editor
        settings on a per-buffer basis. While changes made in the
        <guimenuitem>Buffer Options</guimenuitem> dialog box are lost after the
        buffer is closed, buffer-local properties take effect each time the file
        is opened, because they are embedded in the file itself.</para>

        <para>When jEdit loads a file, it checks the first and last 10 lines for
        colon-enclosed name/value pairs. For example, placing the following in a
        buffer changes the indent width to 4 characters, enables soft tabs, and
        activates the Perl edit mode:</para>

        <screen>:indentSize=4:noTabs=true:mode=perl:</screen>

        <para>Adding buffer-local properties to a buffer takes effect after the
        the buffer is saved and loaded again.</para>

        <para>The following table describes each buffer-local property in
        detail.</para>

        <para> You may see <literal>:encoding=XXX:</literal> in a file

        differently.
        It is detected by <literal>buffer-local-properties</literal> detector
        only if the detector is selected in encoding options. Thus, it works
        only at loading, and it must appear near the top of the file.

        displays the options dialog box.
        It has 2 tabs, the first one is <guimenu>Global Options</guimenu>.
        The dialog
        box is divided into several panes, each pane containing a set of related
        options. Use the list on the left of the dialog box to switch between
        panes. Only panes created by jEdit are described here; some plugins add
        their own option panes, and information about them can be found in the
        documentation for the plugins in question.</para>

        <section id="general-pane">
            <title>The General Pane</title>
            <para>The <guibutton>General</guibutton> pane contains various
            settings, such as
            the number of recent files to remember, when to check for changed files,
            if the recent file list should be sorted, what current locale to use, 
            if caret positions or markers in buffers should be saved, 
            if previously open files or split configurations should be restored on startup, 
            and so on.</para>

            <para> If <guilabel>Do Nothing</guilabel> is selected, then modifications from
            jEdit will silently clobber changes made from other processes during saves.
            Don't use this option unless you know what you are doing! Also, changing this
            option here only affects newly opened buffers, not the ones that are currently 
            open. You can also change this setting for individual buffers from 
            Buffer Options. <xref linkend="buffer-opts"/> </para>

            <para> This option allows you choose additional times that jEdit checks for
            changed files on disk. For slow or remote file systems, removing unnecessary
            file status checks might improve performance. 
            Regardless of the choice here, files are still checked before
            save, unless <guilabel>Do Nothing</guilabel> is also selected 
            for the previous option. </para>

            <para>The combo box labelled <quote>Abbrev set</quote> selects the

            <para>The <literal>List of Fallback Encodings</literal> is used when
            a file fails to open in the default encoding, and the Encoding
            Autodetectors also fail. The list order here determines the order of
            encodings that are tried. Each is separated by a space. This is
            especially handy when doing directory searches through files of
            different encodings. We suggest using <literal>UTF-8</literal> as
            either your default or one of the fallback encodings.</para>

            <para>While jEdit allows you to edit files in a variety of different
            encodings, the average user switches between only 2 or 3. In other
            parts of jEdit, where the list of encodings is displayed in a
            combobox (such as the buffer options) or a menu (such as
            <guimenuitem>File - Reload with Encoding</guimenuitem> submenu) it
            may be desirable to display only a subset of available encodings,
            those that are in common local use. The Encodings checkbox list
            allows the user to select the subset of supported encodings to
            display in other GUI components that list all of the
            encodings.</para>

            keyboard shortcuts with commands. Each command can have up to two
            shortcuts associated with it, and each shortcut can be a single
            or multiple key sequence. </para>

            <para>jEdit 5 introduces a new feature known as "keymaps". Each keymap is
            a named set of keyboard shortcut mappings.
            Default keymaps are found in jEdit's <literal>keymaps</literal> folder,
            and user customized keymaps are are stored in the
            user settings' <literal>keymaps</literal> folder. </para>

            <para> The top combobox allows you to <guilabel>Choose a Keymap</guilabel>,
            or a set of shortcuts.
            The "imported" keymap is automatically created and selected when jEdit needs
            to initially create a "keymaps" user settings folder.
            At this point, jEdit imports the existing shortcuts and places them into
            "imported". This makes it easy to bring in shortcuts
            from properties files that were customized with jEdit 4.5 or earlier. </para>

            <para> If a keymap of the same name exists in the defaults and the user settings
            directory, the user version is the one that is used in favor of the default.
            To take an existing keymap and customize it, select it, click
            <guibutton>duplicate</guibutton> and you will be asked for the name of the new
            keymap. A copy of that keymap will be
            saved in the user settings <literal>keymaps</literal> directory. At this point,
            this keymap will be selected and will determine where new shortcut properties are
            stored. To remove all customizations and restore a default keymap,
            click <guibutton>reset</guibutton>. </para>

            <para>The combo box below the keymap selector selects the
            command set to edit. Command sets exist for the set of all built-in
            commands, the commands of each plugin, and the set of macros.</para>

            <para>To change a shortcut, click the appropriate table entry and
            press the keys you want associated with that command in the
            resulting dialog box. The dialog box will warn you if the shortcut
            is already assigned. The properties will be saved in the currently selected

    <section id="settings-directory">
        <title>The jEdit Settings Directory</title>

        <para>jEdit stores settings, macros, and plugins as files inside the
        <firstterm>settings directory</firstterm>. In most cases, editing these
        files by hand is not necessary, since graphical tools and editor
        commands can do the job. However, being familiar with the structure of
        the settings directory still comes in handy in certain situations, for
        example when you want to copy jEdit settings between computers.</para>

        <para>The location of the settings directory is system-specific
        <footnote><para> On Linux, it is <literal>~/.jedit</literal>. 
           On Windows, you will find it in <literal>%APPDATA%\jEdit</literal>. 
           On the Mac, it is <literal>~/Library/jEdit</literal>. 
        </para></footnote>.
        It is printed to the activity log
        (<guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Troubleshooting</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Activity
        Log</guimenuitem>). For example:</para>

        <screen>[message] jEdit: Settings directory is /home/slava/.jedit</screen>

        <para>Another way to find the location of your settings directory is to
        use the "Utilities" menu, then the "Settings Directory" menu item. The
        first item in the pullout menu is the location of your settings directory.
        </para>

        <para>Specifying the <userinput>-settings</userinput> switch on the
        command line instructs jEdit to store settings in a directory other than
        the default. For example, the following command will instruct jEdit to
        store all settings in the <filename>jedit</filename> subdirectory of the
        <filename>C:</filename> drive:</para>

        <screen><prompt>C:\jedit&gt;</prompt> <userinput>jedit -settings=C:\jedit</userinput></screen>

        <para>The <userinput>-nosettings</userinput> switch will force jEdit to
        not look for or create a settings directory; default settings will be
        used instead.</para>

                directory. This is intended for site-wide settings and it is
                useful for things like a set of custom key bindings that you might
                want to share between different computers. This lets you keep your
                custom properties separate from the jEdit properties, so they are
                easier to find, edit, and move between machines. Note that your
                custom properties files must have ".props" as the file name extension.

                Site properties files are read in alphabetically by file name. This means
                that if you have a property with the same name in more than one file,
                the value for that property will be the value found in the last file
                that was read.

            <para>
                You can edit these files inside jEdit - changes made to these files will not be re-read until the next time jEdit is started.
