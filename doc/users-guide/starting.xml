<chapter id="starting"><title>Starting jEdit</title>
 <sect1 id="conventions"><title>Conventions</title>
  <para>
   Several conventions are used throughout jEdit's user interface and
   this manual. They will be described here.
  </para>
  <para>
   When a menu item selection is being described, the
   top level menu is listed first, followed by successive levels of submenus,
   finally followed by the menu item itself. All menu components are separated
   by greater-than symbols (<quote>&gt;</quote>). For example,
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Scrolling</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Scroll
   to Current Line</guimenuitem> refers to the <guimenuitem>Scroll to Current
   Line</guimenuitem> command contained in the
   <guisubmenu>Scrolling</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.
  </para>
  <para>
   As with many other applications, menu items that end with
   ellipsis (...) display dialog boxes or windows when invoked.
  </para>
  <para>
   Many jEdit commands can be also be invoked using keystrokes. This speeds
   up editing by letting you keep your hands on the keyboard. Not all
   commands with keyboard shortcuts
   are accessible with one key stroke; for example, the
   keyboard shortcut for <guimenuitem>Scroll to Current Line</guimenuitem> is
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>J</keycap></keycombo>. That is, you
   must first
   press <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>, followed by
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>J</keycap></keycombo>.
  </para>
  <para>
   In many dialog boxes, the default button (it has a heavy outline, or a
   special border, depending on the current Swing look and feel) can be activated by
   pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap>. Similarly, pressing
   <keycap>Escape</keycap> will usually close a dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   Finally, some user interface elements (menus, menu items, buttons) have a
   certain letter in their label underlined. Pressing this letter in combination
   with the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key activates the associated user interface
   widget.
  </para>
  <sidebar><title>MacOS</title>
   <para>
    jEdit tries to adapt itself to established conventions when running on
    MacOS.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you are using MacOS, mentally substitute the modifier keys you see in
    this manual as follows:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Read <keycap>Control</keycap> as <keycap>Command</keycap>
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Read <keycap>Alt</keycap> as <keycap>Option</keycap>
    </para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    If you only have a one-button mouse, a right button click (to show a
    context menu, and so on) can be simulated by holding down
    <keycap>Control</keycap> while clicking. A middle button click (to insert
    the most recent selection in the text area) can be simulated by
    holding down <keycap>Option</keycap> while clicking.
   </para>
  </sidebar>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="starting-any-os"><title>Platform-Independent Instructions</title>
  <para>
   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system;
   on Unix systems, usually you would
   run the <quote>jedit</quote> command at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you might
   use the jEditLauncher package, which is documented in
   <xref linkend="starting-windows" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   If jEdit is started while another copy is already running, control is
   transferred to the running copy, and a second instance is not loaded.
   This saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times.
   Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
   TCP/IP sockets; the initial instance is known as the
   <firstterm>server</firstterm>, and subsequent invocations are
   <firstterm>clients</firstterm>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the <userinput>-background</userinput> command line switch is specified,
   jEdit will continue running and waiting for client requests even
   after all editor windows are closed. When run in background mode,
   you can open and close jEdit any number of times, only having
   to wait for it to start the first time. The downside of this
   is that jEdit will continue to consume memory when no windows
   are open.
  </para>
  <para>
   For more information about command line switches that control the
   server feature, see <xref linkend="cli-usage" />.
   Note that if you are using <application>jEditLauncher</application>
   to start jEdit on Windows, this switch cannot be specified on the
   MS-DOS prompt command line when starting jEdit; it must be set as described
   in <xref linkend="launcher-starting" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   Unlike other applications, jEdit automatically loads any files that were
   open last time in was used, so you can get back to work immediately, without
   having to find the files you are working on first. This feature can be
   disabled in the <guibutton>Loading and Saving</guibutton> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
   dialog box; see <xref linkend="global-opts" />.
  </para>
  <sidebar><title>The edit server and security</title>
   <para>
    Not only does the server pick a random TCP port number on startup,
    it also requires that clients provide an <firstterm>authorization
    key</firstterm>; a randomly-generated number only accessible to
    processes running on the local machine.
    So not only will <quote>bad guys</quote> have to guess a 64-bit integer,
    they will need to get it right on the first try; the edit server
    shuts itself off upon receiving an invalid packet.
   </para>
   <para>
    In environments that demand absolute security, the edit server can be
    disabled by specifying the <userinput>-noserver</userinput> command line switch.
   </para>
  </sidebar>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="starting-windows"><title>Starting jEdit on Windows</title>
  <para>
   On Windows, jEdit comes with <emphasis>jEditLauncher</emphasis> - an optional
   package of components that make it easy to start jEdit, manage its command
   line settings, and launch files and macro scripts.
  </para>

  <para>
   The jEditLauncher package provides three shortcuts for running jEdit:  one in
   the desktop's <guilabel>Start</guilabel> menu, a entry in the Programs menu, and
   a third shortcut on your desktop.  Any of these may be deleted or moved without
   affecting jEdit's operation.  To launch jEdit, simply select one of these shortcuts
   as you would for any Windows application.
  </para>

  <para>
   The jEditLauncher package includes a utility for changing the command line
   parameters that are stored with jEditLauncher and used every time it runs jEdit.
   You can change the Java interpreter used to launch jEdit, the amount of heap memory,
   the working directory and other command line parameters.  To make these changes,
   select <guilabel>Set jEdit Parameters</guilabel> from the jEdit group in
   the Programs menu, or run <userinput>jedit /p</userinput> from a command
   line that has jEdit's installation directory in its search path.  A dialog
   will appear that allows you to change and save a new set of command line
   parameters.
  </para>

  <para>
   The package also adds menu items to the context or <quote>right-click</quote>
   menu displayed by the Windows shell when you click on a file item in the
   desktop window, a Windows Explorer window or a standard file selection dialog.
   The menu entries allow  you to open selected files in jEdit, starting the
   application if necessary. It will also allow you to open all files in a
   directory with a given extension with a single menu selection. If a BeanShell
   macro script with a <filename>.bsh</filename> extension is selected, the menu
   includes the option of running that script within jEdit. If you have the
   <application>JDiff</application> plugin installed with jEdit, you can also
   select two files and have jEdit compare them in a side-by-side graphical display.
  </para>

  <para>
   For a more detailed description of all features found in
   the jEditLauncher package, see <xref linkend="launcher-guide"/>.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="cli-usage"><title>Command Line Usage</title>
  <para>
   On operating systems that support a command line, jEdit can be passed
   various arguments to control its behavior.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you are using <application>jEditLauncher</application>
   to start jEdit on Windows, only file names can be specified
   on the command line; the parameters documented below must be set as described
   in <xref linkend="launcher-starting" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   When opening files from the command line, a line number or marker to
   position the caret on can be specified like so:
  </para>
  <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit MyApplet.java +line:10</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit thesis.tex +marker:c</userinput></screen>
  <para>
   A number of options can also be specified to control several obscure features.
   They are listed in the following table.
  </para>
