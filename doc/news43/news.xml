        <title>Preface</title>
		<para>
		No longer will jEdit be called "pre" or "final":
		instead, we are moving over to straight-decimal x.y.z version
		numbering scheme.
		</para>
        <para>jEdit is a very mature text editor, and has gone through a very
        interesting phase of development. Left in a "prerelease" stage for about
        four years, it's had a long time to solifidy. Many of the original
        developers, including Slava Pestov, have stopped working directly on
        jEdit. Fortunately, because of the wonderful nature of open source,
        there are more and more eyeballs on this code than ever! We have
        received contributions of plugins, bugfixes, refactoring, and
        enhancements from around the globe, and our host, sourceforge.net <ulink
        url="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=588&amp;ugn=jedit&amp;type=prdownload&amp;mode=year&amp;package_id=0">reports</ulink>
        that there are on average at least a half-million downloads per year,
        and this has been true for the entire millenium.</para>
        <para>In terms of actual releases, there was a bit of a lull
        while Slava's absense was sinking in among the other members of the
        community, but in 2006, thanks to their generous donations of time,
        effort, and coding skills, we started releasing regular prereleases
        again, fixing bugs in the core and each other's plugins, making jEdit
        more stable, coherent, and useful than ever.</para>
        <para>The thing that really excites me is seeing members of the
        community get more actively involved in improving jedit or its plugins.
        The core is huge, and there are over 164 plugins, so there is an endless
        source of things to do. I anticipate that the trackers will always have
        many open issues, but I see many of the old ones finally being closed,
        and that is very much satisfying. I can say with complete confidence
        that 4.4 is an improvement over 4.2 in every possible way. I hope that
        after you read this document, you will think so too, and perhaps want to
        join in on the development of future versions of jEdit or its
        plugins.</para>
        <para>I watch the tracker traffic (<literal>jedit-devel</literal>) and
        commit logs (in the <literal>jedit-commits</literal> mailing list) with
        fascination, learning new Java tricks, or new jEdit tricks. It's quite
        satisfying to be this intimate with code that I find I am using every
        day. I feel I am on a first-name basis with all of the active
        committers, and I've given and/or received help from every one of them.
        While it is true, there are parts of it that could be designed a little
        better, it is still the best open source editor I've seen. Thanks to the
        plugins themselves, because they are broken up into neat little
        packages, it is easier for us to isolate and fix bugs. As long as I am
        using it, I will be compelled to fix bugs that annoy me, be they in the
        core, or any of the plugins I happen to use.</para>

        <listitem><para> The Dockable Interface has been enhanced and made
        into a jEdit service, so it is possible for plugins to offer alternate
        dockable window managers. Some of them give jEdit a very
        Eclipse-like feel. In addition, it is now possible to save and load
        dockable layouts, which are analogous to Eclipse perspectives.

        <section id="readded">
            <title>Re-added Features</title>
            <para>Soft wrapping to the text area, one of my personal favorite
            features, is possible again, by setting the wrap width to zero.
            Thank you Slava! I really missed that feature. It's probably the
            main reason I started using, testing, and later developing jEdit
            4.3.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="plugin-manager">
            <title>Plugin Manager</title>
            <para>The three panes of the PluginManager have all been reworked
            and made more keyboard friendly. They handle multiple selections,
            show more information, allow sorting on more columns, the checkbox
            states don't get lost when you switch panes, and the manage panel
            now automatically loads dependent plugins if they are already
            downloaded. Anyone who is used to 4.2's plugin manager will notice
            the difference immediately.</para>
            <para>From the Manage tab, it is now possible to save a set of
            installed plugins as a PluginSet. This is an XML file which can be
            located locally on your machine, or remotely on a network. Each time
            the Install tab is instantiated, the PluginSet is loaded and the set
            of plugins are checked for you to download and install.</para>
            <para>If you are a plugin developer, see <xref
            linkend="api-changes" />.</para>

            url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/imf/index.html">Input
            Methods</ulink> are now supported in jEdit. This should make it much
            easier for people to use alternate keyboard input methods to use
            jEdit and enter Chinese/Korean/Japanese characters, as well as other
            alternative input devices. Thank you, Kazutoshi Satoda, for
            fixing that and many other encoding and internationalization problems that
            prevented non-English speaking users from using jEdit properly
            in their native language.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="syntax">
            <title>Syntax Highlighting</title>
            <para>Many syntax highlighting modes were updated or rewritten to
            use the java.util.regex instead of gnu.regexp. Some modes were
            added, bring the total now to 150 languages.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="regexp-changes">
            <title>Regular Expressions</title>
            <para>Most of the core code has been rewritten to use
            <literal>java.util.regex</literal> instead of
            <literal>gnu.regexp</literal>, so be sure to keep that in mind as
            you are composing your own regular expressions, whether they are in
            mode files, search expressions, or in your own plugins. XSearch
            plugin and others still use <literal>gnu.regexp</literal> plugin,
            which offers the legacy regex engine, in case the old behavior is
            still desired. </para>

            <title>Handling of Multiple Encodings</title>
            <para>A full list of encodings supported by your Java implementation

            <guimenu>Commands</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Encoding</guimenuitem>
            menu and other places. Previously only a small list of common
            encodings was shown.</para>
            <para>You can choose which of this list you want to display in the
            Encodings general options pane. You can also choose the fallback
            order of encodings to try in the event of decode errors in the
            General option pane.</para>
            <para>The encoding used by XML files is (should be?) auto-detected
            if the file provides an XML declaration like the following:</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</programlisting>

        <section id="vfs.browser">
            <title>File System Browser</title>
            <para>The file system browser is much more keyboard friendly, and
            supports some common shortcuts set by default in KDE and Windows
            (del, f2, f5, A+Left and A+Right for history, A+up for parent dir).</para>

        <section id="bundled-macros">
            <title>Bundled Macros</title>
            <para>There are a number of new bundled macros, and most of the
            existing ones have undergone enhancements and bug fixes. jEdit 4.2
            bundled 58 macros in 7 categories; jEdit 4.3 bundles 75 macros in 9
            categories.</para>
            <para>Of course you can create new macros of your own, either by
            recording actions or writing them from scratch.</para>

    <chapter id="api-changes">
        <title>API Changes</title>
        <para>There are quite a few API changes which are documented, in the
        source as well as the <ulink url="../CORE_GUIDELINES.txt">core
        guidelines</ulink> and the <ulink
        url="../CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</ulink> documents. If ever you find

        <section id="buffervsjeditbuffer">
            <title>Buffer vs jEditBuffer</title>
            <para>Now that the text area is independent of the rest of jEdit,
            various text area-related APIs that used to take
            org.gjt.sp.jedit.Buffer instances now take
            org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.JEditBuffers.</para>
            <para>BufferChangeListener and BufferChangeAdapter are now
            deprecated. Use BufferListener instead.</para>

        <section id="api-plugins">
            <title>Plugin API changes</title>
            <para>jEdit 4.2 used to run plugins that were designed only for the
            4.1 plugin API, but plugins that are missing the "activate" property
            will no longer load properly in 4.3.</para>
            <para>There are two new properties that all plugins can have:
            <literal>description</literal> and
            <literal>longdescription</literal>. The former is just a string
            property, while the latter is a reference to an html or text file.
            See EditPlugin API docs for details.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="dockable-interface">
            <title>Dockable Interface</title>
            <para>A new boolean attribute, <literal>MOVABLE</literal>, can now
            be specified for <literal>DOCKABLE</literal> tags in the
            <literal>dockables.xml</literal> file. This attribute specifies the
            behavior when the docking position of the dockable window is
            changed. If true, the existing instance of the dockable window is
            moved to the new docking position, thus maintaining its state after
            the move (this is the new behavior). If false, the BeanShell code is
            invoked to get the instance to put in the new docking position (this
            is the existing behavior). The BeanShell code typically returns a
            new instance of the dockable, cause the state to be lost as a result
            of the change in docking position. The default value of this
            attribute is false for backward compatibility.</para>
            <para>A new interface, <ulink
            url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/gui/DockableWindow.html">DockableWindow</ulink>,
            is introduced for <literal>MOVABLE</literal> dockable windows to be
            notified before their docking position is changed. This enables
            dockable windows to react to this change, e.g. by changing their
            layout depending on whether they are docked at the top/bottom or the
            left/right. This interface is meaningless (for now) for non-MOVABLE
            dockable windows.</para>
            <para>A new Service, <ulink
            url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/gui/DockableWindowManagerProvider.html">DockableWindowManagerProvier</ulink>
            is introduced to permit plugins to offer alternate dockable
            frameworks, replacing the legacy dockables that are starting to
            look rather old. </para>
        </section>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="new-plugins">
        <title>The core plugins</title>
        <para>This chapter showcases the new(er) plugins that were under the
        most active development during jEdit 4.3. Some of them influenced the
        development of the jEdit core, and others are good enough to be
        incorporated into the core, but are left as separate plugins simply
        because it makes it easier for us to maintain and debug them.</para>
		<para>The latest version of <emphasis role="bold">Console</emphasis>
		has many improvements, and takes advantage of new features of jEdit. </para>
        <para>Navigator, providing a navigable history, is new and improved - it
        provides the user with Eclipse-like Navigation to previous locations,
        for each TextArea of each View. It uses new EditBus messages which
        are now available in the public API, PositionChanging and
        BufferChanging.</para>
        <bridgehead>ProjectViewer</bridgehead>
        <para>For managing groups of files and organizing them into trees,
        ProjectViewer is very useful. It's been under active development, and
        many bugs are fixed quickly after they are found. Its ability to filter
        its input set based on regular expressions or the contents of
        CVS/SVN/Perforce entries makes it especially handy for other plugins
        that use it, such as <emphasis role="bold">FastOpen</emphasis> and
        <emphasis role="bold">OpenIt</emphasis>, both of which are also recently
        updated for 4.3.</para>
        <para>ProjectViewer is also very important for language plugins that
        want to deal with file sets. It defines a project-wide property
        specification, that makes it possible to have different settings
        depending on what the active project is.</para>
        <bridgehead>SideKicks and Language Plugins</bridgehead>
        <para>SideKick has been debugged and the documentation has been
        improved. Further, there is a new combobox that lets you choose your
        parser, and a new SplitPane to show you the contents of the hovered
        element. The combobox is especially important since there are multiple
        parsers that can be used on a given file, especially when you are
        working with Python, PHP, HTML, XML, or JavaScript files.</para>
        <para>Many language-specific plugins have been redesigned to use the new
        and improved SideKick. In particular, CtagsSideKick (a replacement for
        CodeBrowser), JPyDebug, JythonInterpreter, RubyPlugin, PHPParser,
        JavaSideKick, XML, and PerlSideKick. Be sure to try them out.</para>
        <para>In case you're looking for JavaCore, JBrowse, CodeAid,
        DotComplete, or PropertySideKick, they have all been merged (in terms of
        functionality) into the new JavaSideKick plugin. Some other plugins that
		depend on these above plugins still need to be converted to use
		JavaSideKick instead of the old java plugins listed above. </para>
        <para>As for HtmlSideKick, JavaScriptSideKick, and XmlIndenter, they
        have all been merged into the new XML 2 plugin, which now includes two
        parsers for CSS, one for Ecmascript, and completion popups for elements
        and attributes in XML, CSS, and HTML.</para>
        <para>If you use many different languages, you should also try out the
        very clever ContextMenu plugin. </para>
		<para>The SVNPlugin is new, and the JDiff plugin is improved. Many
		other plugins have latest versions that require jEdit 4.3. </para>

        <title>Future Plans</title>
        <para>During this process of cleaning up jEdit, I started on many
        projects and did not finish them. They are still worthwhile projects,
        ones I would like to get back to. As always, if there are any volunteers
        who would like to help out with them, please join the
