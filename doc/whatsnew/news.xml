    <para> Detailed changes can always be found in the <ulink
    url="../CHANGES.txt">Detailed Change Log</ulink>,
    but here are some of the major features of this version. </para>

    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para> Localization - jEdit now supports switching
    between default locale, French, German, Russian, Czech, and Japanese.
    Some translations for those locales are provided, containing
    common jEdit labels. It is also now possible to add new or contribute
    to existing translation property files for jEdit core
    as well as for plugins.
    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para> Keymaps - named collections of shortcuts. Example keymaps
    for Emacs, MacOS, German Keyboard, Intellij and classic jEdit are provided,
    and users can create or customize them.
    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para> New Editing options: Disable or simplified automatic
    indentation, and default response when opening a large file.
    </para></listitem>

    
    <listitem><para> Updated html/css edit modes with HTML5/CSS3 keywords.
    Added a dozen new edit modes, updated a dozen more.
    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para> Scrolling - Many bugs (#2832769, #2998294, #3193168,
    possibly others), related to soft wrap, multiline delete/cut, undo, and
    folding, that could cause the text area to be confused about its location,
    are fixed. This greatly improves the stability of jEdit. Thank you,
    Thomas Meyer!!  </para></listitem>
