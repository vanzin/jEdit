    <para> Detailed changes can always be found in the <ulink
    url="../CHANGES.txt">Detailed Change Log</ulink>,
    but here are some of the major features of this version. </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>VFS WorkThreads have been rewritten into Tasks, making it 
      possible to completely remove the old "I/O Progress Monitor" and the 
      wasteful space it took up in the Task Monitor. Old deprecated
      classes related to WorkThread and WorkThreadPool have been removed.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para> New Plugin Manager option to check for and disable
      obsolete plugins. 
      Enabled by default, this will ensure that old unsupported plugins do not
      interfere with the running operation of jEdit. </para> 
    </listitem>
    <listitem><para> Added another language to our list of translated languages:
    English, French, German, Japanese, Czech, Russian, and now Chinese!
    We are always looking for volunteers to help translate jEdit into Hindi,
    Korean, or Spanish, or any other language, really! It is fairly easy
    to add a new translation to jEdit or the plugins. 
    </para></listitem>
    
    <listitem><para> There is now a new encoding Native2ASCII which collapses
    unicode escapes in ISO-8859-1 files on read and expands characters that
    cannot be encoded with ASCII as unicode escapes on write. This encoding is
    the one Java properties files should be in.
