    <para> Detailed changes can always be found in the <ulink
    url="../CHANGES.txt">Detailed Change Log</ulink>,
    but here are some of the major features of this version. </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>VFS WorkThreads have been rewritten into Tasks, making it 
      possible to completely remove the old "I/O Progress Monitor" and the 
      wasteful space it took up in the Task Monitor. Old deprecated
      classes related to WorkThread and WorkThreadPool have been removed.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para> New Plugin Manager option to check for and disable
      obsolete plugins. 
      Enabled by default, this will ensure that old unsupported plugins do not
      interfere with the running operation of jEdit. </para>
