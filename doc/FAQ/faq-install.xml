                    <para>What is the easiest way to install jEdit?</para>
                </question>

                <answer>
                    <para>First, make sure you have a working installation of
                    the Java platform. To run jEdit, you will a platform package
                    having a version number of at least 1.5.0_06. If you do not
                    have the Java platform, we recommend downloading the larger
                    <quote>Software Development Kit</quote> (SDK), instead of
                    the smaller <quote>Java Runtime Environment</quote> (JRE),
                    because you will need the tools supplied with the SDK if you
                    will be using Java for development. You will need to know
                    the path of the Java application launcher, which is called
                    <filename>java.exe</filename> on Windows systems and simply
                    <filename>java</filename> on others.</para>

                    <para>Next, decide whether you want the current stable
                    version or the latest development version. As a general
                    rule, the stable version is a good choice for first-time
                    users. However, jEdit 4.3pre7 has been in development for a
                    couple of years now, and it is definitely "stable" enough
                    for beginners. Download the Java installer for the version
                    you have chosen from the jEdit web site; it consists of a
                    single file with a name in the style
                    <filename>jeditXXXinstall.jar</filename>. This file is a
                    compressed archive containing all of the files you need for
                    jEdit to run as well as an installer application written in
                    Java. You can put this file anywhere on your hard disk that
                    is convenient.</para>

                    <para>To run the installer, do whatever you normally do to
                    run a Java jar archive. If this is your first time, follow
                    these steps:</para>

                    <procedure>
                        <step>
                            <para>Open a terminal or command interpreter
                            window.</para>
                        </step>

                        <step>
                            <para>Change the current directory to the directory
                            in which you have stored the jEdit installer
                            file.</para>
                        </step>

                        <step>
                            <para>Run this command: <userinput>[full path to java
                            application launcher] -jar
                            jeditXXXinstall.jar</userinput></para>
                        </step>
                    </procedure>

                    <para>The installer will load and display a series of
                    dialogs for selecting a few simple options, including the
                    directory in which you wish jEdit installed. It will also
                    tell you how much disk space you need for the main program
                    and various installation options.</para>

                    <para>If this is your first download of jEdit, you should
                    definitely install the set of macros that come with the
                    application. Many of them are useful for all programmers,
                    and even the ones you don't use can serve as models when you
                    eventually begin writing your own macros.</para>

                    <para>The installation process is very short. If you are
                    installing the program on Windows and you select the
                    jEditLauncher option, you should be able to start jEdit by
                    clicking on any of the icons that the installation program
                    provides. On other systems, you can enter
                    <userinput>jedit</userinput> in a terminal window or create
                    your own desktop or menu shortcut.</para>

                <question id="java-web-start">
                    <para>Why is there no Java Web Start version of
                    jEdit?</para>
                </question>

                <answer>
                    <para>In Java Web Start, dynamically-loaded classes (ie,
                    plugins) run in a sandbox unless they are explicitly signed.
                    Also, the protocol handler API prevents protocol handlers
                    from being added if they are not loaded via the system class
                    loader (i.e via the Java Web Start class loader). So the
                    lack of plugin support and jeditresource protocol makes it
                    useless.</para>

                    <para>Simply delete the existing jEdit directory and run the
                    installer (if any) to install the new version. Settings are

                    need to remove it from the command line, or use one of the
