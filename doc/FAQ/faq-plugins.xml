                <answer>
                    <para>Writing a plugin requires a working knowledge of Java
                    and some familiarity with jEdit's Plugin API. There is a
                    tutorial on plugin development in the jEdit User's Guide.
                    The source code distribution for jEdit also includes the
                    source for an example plugin, <application>Quick
                    Notepad</application>, which is discussed in the
                    tutorial.</para>
                    <para>To learn more about plugin development, take a look at
                    the source code for other plugins, particularly those whose
                    features or user interface you might use as a model. The
