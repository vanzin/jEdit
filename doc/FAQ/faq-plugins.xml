	<question id="plugin-install-manual">
		<para>
			How do I install a plugin manually, without using the Plugin Manager?
		</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
		<para>
			Copy the plugin's jar archive file (or files, if there are more than one)
			to the <filename>/jars</filename> subdirectory of either (a) the directory in
			which jEdit is installed, or (b) your user settings directory (which you can find
			by evaluating the BeanShell expression
			<userinput>jEdit.getSettingsDirectory()</userinput>.

	<question id="plugin-loading">
		<para>
			Why can't plugins be loaded dynamically (i.e. not having to restart)?
		</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
		<para>
			There are plans to support such a feature in jEdit 4.2, however it will
      likely require a different plugin API, so existing plugins will need to
      be updated to take advantage of it.

  <question id="plugins-developing">
    <para>
      How do I write a plugin?
    </para>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <para>
      Writing a plugin requires a working knowledge of Java and some
      familiarity with jEdit's Plugin API.  There is a tutorial on
      plugin development in the jEdit User's Guide.  The source
      code distribution for jEdit also includes the source for
      an example plugin, <application>Quick Notepad</application>, which
      is discussed in the tutorial.
    </para>
    <para>
      To learn more about plugin development, take a look at the source
      code for other plugins, particularly those whose features or user
      interface you might use as a model.  The <ulink
      url="mailto:devel@jedit.org">jedit-devel mailing list</ulink> and
      the message boards at <ulink url="http://community.jedit.org">jEdit
      Community</ulink> are also available for specific questions.

	<question id="plugin-console-execute">
		<para>
			Is it possible to execute your application from within jedit?
		</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
		<para>
			Yes. You can use the System shell of the Console plugin to run you application.
			The only limitation is that the plugin does not provide access to the
			application's standard input stream, so you will not be able to provide
			command-line input once the application is running. If the application requires
			such input, it will hang and you will have to terminate its process. Details are
			available in the help documentation for the Console plugin.
