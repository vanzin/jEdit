                <answer>
                    <para>jEdit is a programmer's text editor written in Java,
                    originally developed by Slava Pestov, now maintained by
                    others. It has an easy to use interface that resembles that
                    of many other Windows and MacOS text editors. It is also
                    highly customizable, and contains a <quote>plugin</quote>
                    architecture that allows its features to be extended by
                    additional programs.</para>

                    <para>What is the difference between a text editor and a
                    word processor?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>These categories are not absolute but refer to the
                    primary purpose of an editing program and the focus of its
                    features.</para>
                    <para>A text editor is an application that edits files
                    containing plain text without automatically formatting the
                    text for printing or other publication. Typically the
                    contents of such a file consists of data used by another
                    application - for example, source code that a compiler will
                    process or markup text that a web browser will display. A
                    word processor deals with the preparation of documents for
                    printing or similar publication. Besides editing text, a
                    modern word processor allows the user to choose multiple
                    fonts, margin sizes, line spacing, indentation, and a
                    variety of other details that affect the appearance of the
                    document being edited. In a text editor, these features are
                    present, if at all, only in a basic form, and for the
                    limited purpose of helping the user compose and organize the
                    text. In place of word processing features, a text editor
                    contains many features that allow the user to prepare and
                    work with text quickly and efficiently.</para>
                    <para>The jEdit application is a text editor, not a word
                    processor. It contains a large assortment of features for
                    manipulating source code, markup text, and other text files.
                    As a programmer's text editor, it also has many features to
                    help programmers manage their projects and work with other
                    programming tools.</para>

                <answer>
                    <para>A plugin is an application that is designed to work
                    with jEdit by providing additional features that can be used
                    from within the main program. Often the plugin will provide
                    a visible user interface in a window that can be docked to
                    jEdit's main view window.</para>
                    <para>There are currently over 120 publicly available
                    plugins that provide such services as a Java source code

                    source code project management. They can be downloaded,
                    installed, and kept current from within jEdit's

                    <para>Absolutely not. Many of the jEdit's plugin

                    to work with any programming or markup language. Included
                    with jEdit are packages providing syntax highlighting,

                    <para>At some point in your use of jEdit, you will no doubt
                    want to write your own macros to execute long or complex
                    routines with a single command or keyboard shortcut. Macros
                    in jEdit are written in a simplified dialect of Java called

                    Its syntax will be familiar to users of Java, C++ and other

                    if you have no experience with those languages. The User's
                    Guide provided with jEdit contains an extensive tutorial on

                    <para>Since jEdit runs on a Java platform, at a minimum you
                    will need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) package. If you
                    are planning to use jEdit to program in Java, you will need
                    a full Java Development Kit (JDK) package. We recommend
                    obtaining a JDK package.</para>
                    <para>The current version of jEdit, version 4.3, requires a
                    Java runtime environment having a release version of 1.5 or
                    greater. It will not run on versions 1.4 or 1.3. The <ulink

                    jEdit, the Java platform and operating system you are using,
                    because bugs often arise that are specific to particular
                    versions. Sometimes the bug arises from the Java runtime
                    environment or even the operating system, and knowing these
                    details helps the developer team design testing and other

                    information regarding your jEdit installation and a stack
                    trace from the last error recorded by jEdit's Activity Log
                    and places it in a new text buffer. In many cases, the
                    information furnished by the macro is all that is necessary
                    to provide a helpful description of a bug. You can simply

                <answer>
                    <para>The program is in a continuing state of evolution. It
                    is usually available in two versions, a
                    <quote>stable</quote> version and a
                    <quote>development</quote> version. A stable version
                    represents a release of jEdit that is considered to be free
                    of serious bugs or performance problems and suitable for
                    general use. A <quote>development</quote> version includes
                    new features or new elements of program design that require
                    testing and possible further refinement. A development
                    version contains the token <quote>pre</quote> in its version
                    number, as in <literal>4.3pre5</literal>.</para>
                    <para>The latest stable and development versions of jEdit
                    are always available from the <ulink
                    url="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit web site</ulink> and from
                    the <ulink

                    which hosts jEdit's development resources.</para>
                    <para>In addition, a plugin named <application>Check jEdit
                    Version</application> can be run from within jEdit by
                    selecting <guimenuitem>Check jEdit Version</guimenuitem>
                    from the application's <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu> menu. It
                    queries the jEdit web site, compares version information
                    with the version of the currently running instance of jEdit,
                    and reports the result to the user in a message box. It will
                    tell you if you do not have the latest version of jEdit,
                    regardless of whether that version is in
                    <quote>stable</quote> or <quote>development</quote>
                    form.</para>
