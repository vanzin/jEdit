                <question id="wont-start">
                    <para>jEdit won't start. What should I do?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>If you don't have a clue as to why you cannot run
                    jEdit, it's best to perform a step-by-step diagnosis. If it
                    never worked before, begin by finding the Java application
                    loader you are using: <filename>java.exe</filename>,
                    <filename>javaw.exe</filename> or <filename>java</filename>.
                    Make sure it is running by entering its full path with the
                    <userinput>-h</userinput> parameter in a terminal or console
                    window. If you can't find the Java application loader, your
                    Java runtime environment package may be missing or
                    incomplete.</para>
                    <para>Next, find where you have installed jEdit. You should
                    look for the file <filename>jedit.jar</filename> which
                    contains all of the application's Java class files in a
                    compressed archive.</para>
                    <para>Once you have both files, run the Java loader with the
                    <userinput>-jar</userinput> option and with
                    <filename>jedit.jar</filename> as the target. Make sure that
                    you either specify full paths for both files or that the
                    directories for the files are part of your
                    <filename>PATH</filename> environment variable. If jEdit
                    does not load at this point, the likely problem is a corrupt
                    <filename>jedit.jar</filename> file. Try downloading the
                    application again.</para>
                    <para>If jEdit does load using this procedure, you need to
                    examine the <quote>shortcut</quote> loading mechanism you
                    wish to use.</para>
                    <para>On Linux and MacOS X, you need to find and examine the
                    <filename>jedit</filename> shell script provided by the
                    installation routine to confirm that the script's commands
                    target the correct files and locations, and that variables
                    like <filename>JAVA_HOME</filename> are either defined in
                    the script or elsewhere in your shell's environment. Don't
                    forget to make sure that the script's file permissions allow
                    you to execute it as a shell script.</para>
                    <para>On Windows, if you are using a batch script to run
                    jEdit, the same points (other than file permissions) apply
                    to examining <filename>jedit.bat</filename>. If you are
                    using jEditLauncher, run <userinput>jedit /p</userinput> in
                    jEdit's installation directory from a command line to get
                    the custom loader's setup dialog. Here you can check the
                    paths for both the Java application loader and jEdit as well
                    as any command line parameters for both programs. Make sure
                    that you have placed Java and jEdit options in the correct
                    input fields. If the parameters seems correct but jEdit will
                    not load with the Windows launcher, try uninstalling and
                    reinstalling the launcher by running <userinput>jedit
                    /u</userinput> followed by <userinput>jedit
                    /i</userinput>.</para>
                    <bridgehead>But it worked before! It just stopped working
                    after an upgrade. What should I do?</bridgehead>
                    <para>If it used to work for an older version and no longer
                    works, it could be that you have some old crud (bad
                    settings, unsupported plugins) in your jEdit
                    settings directory (<literal>~/.jedit</literal> on Linux,
                    <literal>%APPDATA%\jEdit</literal> on Windows, or
                    <literal>~/Library/jEdit</literal> on MacOS).
                    You may want to try renaming the offending directory
                    to something else, and restarting jEdit with fresh settings.
                    You can later copy things from your old settings back 
                    if you find you are missing things. </para>
                    <para>If at this point you're still stuck, ask for help on
                    the jedit-users mailing list, the jEdit Community
                    <quote>Installation</quote> message board or on IRC. You're

                <question id="start-missing-plugins">
                    <para>After jEdit starts, I can't see all of the plugins I
                    have downloaded. How can I make them appear?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>If you use jEdit's Plugin Manager to download and
                    install plugins, your plugins will be found in the
                    <filename>jars</filename> subdirectory of one of two
                    directories: either the directory in which jEdit is
                    installed, or the current user's settings directory. These
                    are the only location jEdit examines when it loads plugins
                    at startup.</para>
                    <para>The default location of the settings directory depends
                    on your operating system. You can find out its location
                    during a jEdit session by evaluating
                    <userinput>jedit.getSettingsDirectory()</userinput> in
                    BeanShell.</para>
                    <para>The settings directory can be changed by using the
                    <userinput>-settings</userinput> command line parameter. If
                    you change the location of the settings directory with this
                    parameter, jEdit will not be able to find plugin archive
                    files in the old location. If you use or change the
                    <userinput>-settings</userinput> parameter, make sure your
                    plugins don't get left behind.</para>

                <question id="problems-out-of-memory">
                    <para>During an editing session I get an error message about
                    an <quote>OutOfMemoryError</quote> while working with a
                    large file or performing a lengthy operation. The message
                    reappears every time I retry the operation. How can I
                    prevent this?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                	<para>The memory requirements of jEdit vary greatly
                	depending on how many files are in use, and what plugins
                	you are using. You can see how much it is using in the
                	status bar. </para>
                    <para>One solution that often works is to set or increase
                    the allocation of memory to the heap for Java objects
                    created by the Java Virtual Machine in which jEdit is
                    running. Add a command line option
                    <userinput>-Xmx640m</userinput> to the options passed to the
                    version of the Java application loader you are using (such
                    as <filename>java</filename>, <filename>java.exe</filename>
                    or <filename>javaw.exe</filename>). In place of the
                    <userinput>640</userinput> in the option, use a number
                    of megabytes you think is appropriate for the maximum heap
                    size. If you already are using the option, try doubling it. 
                    </para>
                    <para>If you are using the <userinput>-jar</userinput>
                    command line option with Java to run jEdit, remember that
                    the <userinput>-jar</userinput> parameter must be the last
                    Java option, followed immediately by the path to
                    <filename>jedit.jar</filename> and then any jEdit command
                    line options.</para>
                    
                    <para> On Windows, if you are using the <literal>jedit.exe</literal> launcher, you can add
                    or change the JVM arguments by editing a file called <literal>jEdit.l4j.ini</literal> in the same directory
                    as the <literal>jedit.exe</literal>. Place one 
                    JVM argument (e.g. <literal>-Xmx512m</literal>) on each
                    line by itself. </para> 
                    
                    <para>If out of memory errors occur while running a build or
                    compilation operation from within jEdit, you can also have
                    the operation run in an external process rather than inside
                    the same Java Virtual Machine running jEdit. The AntFarm
                    plugin, for example, lets you select this approach as a
                    configuration option. In other cases, you can run an
                    external program using the command line interface of the
                    Console plugin, which will capture and display the output of
                    the external process and in many cases parse the output for
                    error information.</para>

                    should I do?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>It happens to me sometimes too. I have this macro to work around it for now:
<programlisting>
/** Reset_TextArea.bsh */
view.splitVertically();
view.unsplitCurrent();
</programlisting>
					Run this, and jEdit creates
                    a new TextArea for you, and that one won't be confused. This
                    can help avoid the need to restart jEdit. If you can
                    reproduce the steps you took to cause this, please submit a
                    bug report that details what plugins/versions you were
                    using, and how to reproduce it. It may be specific to a file you are editing, or a particular combination of settings you are using, or sequence of actions you performed. </para>

                    <para>It's important to realise that java applications
                    should never do this. The problem is almost certainly a bug
                    in the JVM. Problems of this nature are often tricky to
                    solve. Depending on your platform, there should be
                    information logged about what caused the crash to occur. For
                    Unix type systems you will likely get an error in the

                    <answer>
                      <para> Sometimes, it can be due to a deadlock, or an
                      infinite loop, or something else. You need to obtain a 
                      <emphasis role="bold">thread dump</emphasis> from the time
                      of hang, and attach that as a textfile to your bug report,
                      explaining what you were doing at the time.
                      </para>

                      <para> One way to obtain a thread dump, is to run jEdit

                      line shell <emphasis role="bold">in the foreground</emphasis>,
                      wait for the hang or lockup, and type Ctrl+\ 
                      (or Ctrl+Break on Windows) into the shell window. 
                      You should see a thread dump printed immediately that will
                      help diagnose the problem.

                      <para>
                      Another way to get a thread dump is to run jEdit as you
                      normally would, then run 
                      <ulink url="http://visualvm.java.net/">visualvm</ulink>.
                      You can right click on the jEdit process from within
                      visualvm and choose "thread dump".

                <answer>
                    <para>There may be many causes for this. Java by nature is
                    more demanding on hardware than native applications. Modern
                    computers should not have much problem with this.</para>
                    <para>The most likely cause is plugins that parse buffers or
                    do other computationally expensive operations. These include
                    XML, JavaSideKick, and CodeAid. If performance is important
                    to you, installing a whole batch of plugins in one go is
                    probably not a very good idea. Install them one at a time,
                    so you can evaluate the effects of each. </para>

                    <para>The problem is not with jEdit but may be caused by
                    your installation of the Java runtime environment. Under
                    Windows, Sun's Java application loader relies on entries in
                    the Windows registry to find the files that create the
                    runtime environment and a Java virtual machine. The loader
                    (<filename>java.exe</filename>e or
                    <filename>javaw.exe</filename>) is unable to find the
                    necessary registration entry and therefore sends the error
                    message. The best approach to fixing this is to uninstall
                    and reinstall the JDK.</para>
