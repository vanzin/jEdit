{{{ Version 4.3

Thanks to Björn "Vampire" Kautler, Marcelo Vanzin, Matthieu Casanova,
Alan Ezust, Eric Berry, and Eric Le Lay for contributing to this release.

{{{ Bug Fixes

- Merged rev# 16624 from trunk, to fix printing which was broken by
  patch#2876132. (Eric Le Lay)

- Applied patch #2876132 - anonymous instances of JARClassLoader will now
  resolve resources like instances associated with a JAR file (fix for Xerces).
  The context ClassLoader for jedit server thread is now a JARClassLoader.
  (Eric Le Lay)

- Fixed bug #2907139: Upgrading from 4.2final to 4.3pre18 causes freeze at
  startup (Shlomy Reinstein)


- Using regex style encoding auto detectors, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
  could happen when loading a file. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- When creating a new file from the VFS Browser, if a clean untitled buffer
  already exists but with another path it is now replaced by a new untitled
  buffer using the selected path (Matthieu Casanova)

- Applied patch #2887515: Navigate in AboutDialog (contributed by spj).
  The name list in the about dialog can be scrolled faster using the up and
  down arrow keys, and the scrolling can be stopped using the right and left
  arrow keys or the escape key.

- EnhancedButton have its name set to the last part of the action name,
  to facilitate unit-tests (e.g. the 'previous' button in the VFSBrowser
  has the action 'vfs.browser.previous', so will be named 'previous').

}}}
{{{ API Changes

- Add support for type-specific EditBus message handlers. EditBus handlers
  don't need to implement EBComponent anymore; they just need to annotate their
  EditBus handler methods with the new "EBHandler" annotation. The methods
  should expect a single argument (an instance of any EBMessage type), and the
  method will be called whenever a message of a matching type is sent on the
  EditBus. Classes that still implement EBComponent will continue to work
  exactly like before, even if they include handlers using the new annotation.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

}}}
{{{ Editing

- Improved indenting rules of Python edit mode. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Reverted a change for jsp mode, which was made on 4.3pre17 to fix a
  bug, since it doesn't work any more. (see SF.net bug #846913)

Thanks to Björn "Vampire" Kautler, Shlomy Reinstein, Alan Ezust, Chepel
Matthieu Casanova, Denis Dzenskevich, Dennis Sheil, Jim Lawton and
Suraj Kurapati for contributing to this release.

{{{ Bug Fixes
- When using the quick syntax edition, if the operation is cancelled, do not
  send a propertiesChanged event (Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed bug #2882702 - Right Click menu shows up to the left of the mouse
  pointer in a multiple monitor environment.

- Fixed bug #2881152 - Bufferset Order is incorrect after a "save as".
  (#2882756 - Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed bug #2806043: Token.tokenToString() throws
  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException on the END token. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- When switching back from fullscreen mode to normal, check property to decide
  whether to show status bar in normal or plain view. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed restoring of view bounds from perspective.xml for dual-monitor
  environments. This was broken by a fix in the previous version for users who
  switch from a dual-monitor environment to a single-monitor environment, and
  now should be fixed indefinitely. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed #2819701: DockableWindowManagerImpl causes NullPointerExceptions.
  (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed #2817321: Exceptions on startup.
  Caused by a backward-incompatibility that was introduced by the BufferSets
  feature, of the "split configuration" format in the perspective.xml file. This
  incompatibility prevented jEdit from starting up for users who upgrade from
  any non-BufferSet version. A workaround for this is to remove perspective.xml,
  but then the previous layout is not restored. With this fix, jEdit should
  start normally with an old perspective.xml file. (#2817321) (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed #2818261: Rectangular Selection Count wrong. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed #2823909: action bar not visible in full screen mode. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed #2825028: Plugins not properly unloaded during exit. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed #2825203: BufferSets not restored correctly on startup.
  (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed the Java based installer not to use an undefined variable
  JAVA_HEAP_INIT_SIZE in Unix startup script. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Fixed #2818327: Plugin Error Dialog issues - allow copying the text from
  the plugin error dialog. (Shlomy Reinstein).

- Fixed #2833822: Selecting "View -> Line numbers" now shows the gutter if it
  was not shown before (otherwise, this has no effect).

- # 2838679 - Support Cygwin xsltproc in build.xml for docs generation
   (Sebastian Schuberth).

- Minor refactoring of Mode class to allow plugins to determine the mode of a
  file without having to necessarily read the first line of the file.  This
  allows huge performance gains in plugins like TaskList that need to determine
  the mode of a large number of files that are not yet opened in jEdit.
  (Dale Anson)

- Fixed #2834900: DockingLayoutManager recursion when handling EditBus msgs.
  Prevented such recursions by avoiding creation of a dockable if it is already
  being created. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fixed syntax highlight when a " appear in a javadoc comment in java mode
  (#2818095) (Denis Dzenskevich)

- Fixed #2808363 (patch #2827234): fix perl highlighting hanging on some
  operators. (Dennis Sheil)

- Applied patch #2842678: Gutter selection problems (Shlomy Reinstein, patch
  provided by encorejane).

- Applied patch #2846169: IndentFoldHandler - allow blank lines after start of
  fold.	(Shlomy Reinstein, patch provided by Suraj Kurapati)

- Applied patch #2844750: line height correction (disappearing underscores),
  using OpenJDK (Suraj Kurapati)

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous
- New Macro - "Text/Compose Tag". (Gordon Hollenbeck # 2644277)

- New action: toggle buffer switcher - toggles visibility of buffer switcher,
    and enabled-ness of focus menu item and focuses if enabled. (ezust)

- New (restored?) Actions: dumb "home" and "end": not as smart as smart
  home/end - stays on the same line always. (Alan Ezust)

- Smarter Smart-end - uses syntax info to determine end of code (before
  start of comment), giving smart-end 4 states instead of the previous 3.
  (Gordon Hollenbeck #2646484).

- New options to select the width and the background color of the selection area
  in the gutter (which is visible when line numbers are not shown).

- New button in Hypersearch dockable panel to stop an hypersearch
  (patch #2842444) (encorejane)
}}}
{{{ API Changes

- Renamed "EditPane.showBufferSwitcher()" to "focusBufferSwitcher", and the
  corresponding action that invokes it. (Alan Ezust)

- New method: TextArea.goToEndOfCode() (Gordon Hollenbeck #2646484).

- Removed deprecated TextAreaUpdate EBMessage. Use EditPaneUpdate instead.
    (Alan Ezust)

- Moved EditorExiting ebmessage earlier, before the unloading of plugin jars
  so plugins can catch it and act appropriately during shutdown. (Alan Ezust)

- Added support for undo-aware plugins:
    - A new interface: org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.BufferUndoListener
      This interface defines a listener that gets notified whenever undo/redo
      are performed on a buffer. The listener can be added to / removed from
      a buffer using:
      JEditBuffer.addBufferUndoListener(BufferUndoListener)
      JEditBuffer.removeBufferUndoListener(BufferUndoListener listener)
    - New methods in JEditBuffer: getUndoId(), canUndo(), canRedo()
      getUndoId() can be used during buffer content changes to find which
      changes are included in the same undo operation. The method returns a
      different undoId for each undo operation, and all changes included in the
      same undo operation get the same undoId. The other two methods return
      true if more items exist in the undo/redo list, respectively.

- New method: FoldHandler.getPrecedingFoldLevels - allows a fold handler to
  specify fold levels of lines preceding a line whose content has changed, to
  support patch #2846169, which makes the fold levels of blank lines depend on
  the first non-whitespace-only line following them. (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Fix for caret position display in status bar (tracker 2220033), relative
  position was not always correct. In conjunction with this, added checkboxes
  in the Status Bar option pane to make the various items in the caret position
  display configurable. (Dale Anson, Kazutoshi Satoda).

- Fix for files in buffer switcher not ordered (tracker 2183929).  Sorting is
  now immediate on changing the preferences in the option dialog (Dale Anson)

- Fix for View->Show Buffer Switcher does not show the buffer switcher (tracker
  2179149) (Dale Anson) This menu item is intended to show the buffer switcher

- Page-scrolling changed to CTRL+SHIFT+scroll instead of SHIFT+scroll
  due to Java on Mac.
  (Seph Soliman)

- Removed redundant TextArea:EditPane map in EditPane.java in favor of a linear
  search through parent container linked list. (Alan Ezust)

  The context menu of the VFS browser now has a "Properties" menu item that
  shows the properties of the selected node(s) in a dialog.

  dialog now shows the mode in which jEdit is running: server,
  server-background, or standalone. (Shlomy Reinstein)

}}}
{{{ API Changes

- Removed deprecated org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.CaretChanging. Use PositionChanging
  instead - the former is no longer being used. (Alan Ezust)

- The keybindings are reloaded when the properties are changed in the standalone
  textarea, and the StandaloneActionSet now takes an url to the actions.xml
  as constructor parameter (patch #2304608) (Dakshinamurthy Karra)

- Added jEdit.openFile(EditPane, ....) methods to explicitely choose an editPane
  to open a file (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added jEdit.newFile(EditPane, ...) methods to explicitely choose an EditPane
  to create a new file (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added org.gjt.sp.jedit.menu.MenuItemTextComparator as the preferred
  alternative for deprecated MiscUtilities.MenuItemCompare.
  (Eric Berry - SF.net patch #2308329)

- Removed BufferSet#getScope(). The scope of bufferset is a property of
  EditPane. Added EditPane#getBufferSetScope() and setBufferSetScope().
  Also removed EditPane#setBufferSet(), which was the way to set the
  scope of buffer set. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Moved access methods for BufferSet instances to be more straightforward.
    - jEdit.getBufferSetManager().getGlobalBufferSet()
      -> jEdit.getGlobalBufferSet()
    - jEdit.getViewBufferSet(view)
      -> view.getLocalBufferSet()
    - jEdit.getEditPaneBufferSet(editPane) /* this might be unused one */
      -> editPane.getBufferSet() /* this is currently used one */

- Removed BufferSetManager#hasListeners() which had always returned true.

- Removed BufferSetManager#clear() which just made inconsistent state.

- Added a new method jEdit.moveBuffer() to explicitly move a buffer in
  a BufferSet.
  This can be used to replace a hacky call of BufferSet#addBufferAt()
  which is used to move the buffer.

- Added OperatingSystem.hasJava16() method and made deprecated
  OperatingSystem.hasJava15() and OperatingSystem.hasJava14() since jEdit
  requires Java 1.5 at least (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added a new interface for docking framework plugins to react to newly loaded
  dockables (fixed bug #2519873). (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Added the API DockingArea.getDockables() to support the Docker plugin.

- Added new constructor to OptionsDialog.OptionsTreeModel that allows setting
  the root group of the tree. (Marcelo Vanzin)

  under that mode. (SF.net patch #1829669 - Eric Berry)

- Removed own back buffers for textarea, which were meant to speed up
  painting textarea, because the effect seemed to be not noticeable and
  not stable over runtime environments, while it broke Background plugin

  property to select the fold painter service to use. The fold style can be
  changed using a new option in Global Options -> Gutter. (feature #1747300)
  (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Changed the "HyperSearch_Results_to_Buffer" macro to include the results of
  all searches, not just the last one, and also the search matcher of each
  search, in order to be able to "import" the search results from
  the buffer later.
  Added a new "Buffer_to_HyperSearch_Results" macro that reads a buffer that
  was previously created by the "HyperSearch_Results_to_Buffer" macro, and
  possibly manipulated manually later, and imports the results from the buffer
  into the HyperSearch Results dockable. This macro handles the
  "regular expression" and "ignore case" options correctly.

  keypress is assigned to "hideTip" action by the Swing framework.  I removed
  this default assignment because nobody care hiding tooltips (#1955140)

{{{ Miscellaneous

- In the auto-indent code, use read-only "CharSequence" instances to avoid
  creating new strings (which results in a copy of the original data). This
  should reduce a little the memory usage of that code. Also change some other

- jEdit will not crash anymore if a beanshell.jar is already in the classpath
  (#893349) (Matthieu Casanova)

- The BufferHistory is now thread safe (#1808797) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Parsing XML files now uses correct encoding (which is declared in its
  source or UTF-8 by default) instead of the system default encoding.
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

  NOTE: Related to this fix, some XML files which are saved by older jEdit
  may not be correctly loaded. They used the system default encoding and
  didn't declare the encoding (meaning they should use UTF-8). recent.xml,
  perspective.xml and registers.xml are known (and fixed).

- Changed the encodings of recent.xml, perspective.xml and registers.xml
  to UTF-8 to allow characters which are not covered by the system default
  encoding in them. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- SF Bug #1764090: Slight Error in jedit.desktop file
  There was actually an error in jEdit.java that caused it to hit an
  NPE when processing URLs provided in the command line. Fix it by not
  trying to find an open buffer when trying to parse an URL in the
  openFile() method. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF Bug #1729313: BeanShell Error on Loading jEdit 4.3pre9
  We need to force the default encoding to UTF-8 when running startup scripts,
  otherwise jEdit will fail to run the scripts shiped with it. On the flip
  side, if the user wants to use a different (non-compatible) encoding that
  is not trivially detected (such as anything with a BOM), a buffer-local
  property defining the encoding should be provided. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- registers.dtd now allow zero ENTRY element in ENTRIES. It required at
  least one ENTRY while jEdit creates zero ENTRY case in registers.xml.
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Fix escape handling in the syntax highlighter. The handling of escape rules
  is now much more simplified: it's not only a lot less code but it's much
  easier to understand what it's actually doing. This fixes the following
  bugs: 1812205, 1807549, 1760646 and 1600458 (although the last one is fixed
  as a side effect, not because the root cause of the bug was fixed.)

- The bsh package was refactored to org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh, all plugins that uses
  classes from this package will have to be repaired. This was necessary to fix
  bug (893349) (Matthieu Casanova)

- A new GUIUtilities.listConfirm() method that returns also the selected items
  in the list (Matthieu Casanova)

- JEditBuffer.undo() and JEditBuffer.redo() now takes a
  org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea as parameter (Matthieu Casanova)

- Cleaned up org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.KillRing to improve independence
  from jEdit's core. This narrowed a few parts of API. This can break
  some existing macros or plugins.
    - It no longer has any protected data field. Use public or protected
      methods including a new protected method reset() instead.
    - KillRing.KillRingHandler was removed because it should be a part
      of the core which does save the killring into a XML file. It
      became a private part of the core.
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Dropped some concrete classes from API. They are just implementation
  details of the core. Use more abstract base classes or interfaces
  instead.
    - org.gjt.sp.jedit.bufferio.JEditKillRing
      -> org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.KillRing
    - org.gjt.sp.jedit.JEditMode
      -> org.gjt.sp.jedit.Mode
    - org.gjt.sp.jedit.JEditRegisterSaver
      -> org.gjt.sp.jedit.RegisterSaver
    - org.gjt.sp.jedit.JEditRegistersListener
      -> org.gjt.sp.jedit.RegistersListener
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Added a new method ModeProvider.getModeForFile() that will try to find an
  appropriate mode for a filename (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added a new method EditPane.initPainter() that can be used when using a
  TextArea in the core or a plugin (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added a new method GUIUtilities.getShortcutLabel() that makes a label
  string to show users what shortcut are assigned to an action.

{{{ Bug Fixes

- NPE in scroll code when deleting some content with no wrap but some
  closed folds (#1763932) (Matthieu Casanova)

- If the cached plugin list xml is broken, it is deleted and reloaded
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed a bug when calling a macro during macro recording (#1765738)
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- Reload/ReloadAll now ignores buffers with the UNTITLED flag set (instead
  of NEW_FILE). (#1720572) (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Bug #1760646: perl colorization
  Escape rules for child rule sets were being ignored. Since the perl mode
  doesn't define a top-level escape char, escaped sequences inside strings
  were not being properly recognized. Fix looks for the contextual escape
  rule before trying to delegate to the parent's escape rule. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Explicit folds are now expanded when deleting the '{' at the fold start
  (#1193683) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Folds are now expanded when inserting new line at the fold start,

  uses %ProgramFiles% (a builin environment variable) instead.
  (SF.net Bug #917669 - Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Changed the default mirror from NONE to switch.
  (bug #1757229) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed the "Evaluate Buffer in BeanShell" macro so that it does what its
  description states, that is evaluating the buffer in current state. Before
  the macro used the last saved state. Additionally the result of the toString()
  method of the return value of the scirpt, if any, is added to the newly
  created buffer in a new line. (bug #1554769) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed inconsistent indentation which happened when adjacent lines both
  match with "unindentThisLine" pattern and they should be placed at first
  column. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Dropping files was broken when using Gnome Nautilus (patch #1795592)
  (xlinuks)

{{{ Bug Fixes

- On windows the read-only flag on folders is ignored now for finding
  the two-stage save name because it has not write protecting function
  in windows. (bug #1719711) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Menu Shorcuts are displayed with the L&F font now if one is

  the BufferUpdate.LOADED message was sent with a null view
  (patch 1744674) (Shlomy Reinstein)

- 1592085 - Now able to abort collection of files for search in directory
  (Alan Ezust)

- A minor bug of cursor changing when dragging dockable panels
  using non continuous layout (Matthieu Casanova)

- special characters in file:// URLs passed on to jEdit.openFile()
  were not being properly decoded (1663617).

- Gutter line number interval highlighting corrected
  when used with soft wrap (patch 1687147 - Stephen Co).

- 1667659 - Fix for FTP I/O regression in 4.3pre9 (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- HyperSearch Results does not lose focus on enter (Bug 1260023,
  Patch 1646058) (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Improved handling of file encoding (patch 1687684) (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Use encoding in buffer histories for temporary buffers (Patch
  1687284) (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- In the logviewer if the tail checkbox is on,
  the last line was not visible after resizing the panel
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- Autoreload buffer without notification was not available in
  General option pane (bug #1641997) (Matthieu Casanova)

- When saving a buffer, if the encoding is unsupported,
  an error dialog appears (Matthieu Casanova)

- A bug when loading a plugin the dependency check had errors :
  for example when you have Sidekick, JavaSidekick and another plugin
  that requires Sidekick (PHPParser, XML ...)
  in your jar folder, all unloaded, try to load the third one,
  the dependency check will try to load JavaSidekick instead of
  Sidekick (Matthieu Casanova)

- VFSBrowser.filesActivated() - passed proper View to jEdit.openFile()
  from FSB open action (Alan Ezust).

- jEdit shell scripts and batch files didn't handle spaces
  in filenames (#1649695) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Macro Single_Space_Buffer was broken (#1525313) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Scrolling up broken after content removing (#1584436) (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Patch #1663901: Improve performance in TokenMarker.handleRule()
  Daniel Hahler reported that jProfiler found some unoptimized code in
  TokenMarker.handleRule(). Instead of applying his patch directly, I
  implemented another approach and also took care of the other case
  of allocating a new string to do a comparison. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF Patch #1656225: Disable encoding auto detection which overrides a selection
  When reloading a file with a specific encoding or changing the encoding in
  the buffer options, disable encoding auto-detection for the buffer.
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- SF Bug #1664900: Auto-indent breaks if previous line is a single line indent
  The "collapse" action used as a hint for the OpenBracketIndentRule needs to
  differentiate between the actions being triggered by code in the previous
  line or by code in the "previous previous" line. This way, for example, a
  "for" declared after an "if" that didn't use brackets will, correctly, not
  be indented one level below the if. See the bug for more "graphical"
  depictions. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Some bugfixes and improvements to ExtendedGridLayout. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed that files were shown in VFSBrowser in choose directory mode.
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Saving a buffer to another VFS was not working (some bugs with markers)
  (bug #1644479) (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Bug #1668893: Wrong conversion to UTF-16 (with BOM)
  A previous change of mine trying to fix another UTF-16 issue actually
  implemented the reverse of what the spec says: UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE don't
  have a BOM, while UTF-16 needs a BOM at the start. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF Patch #1649033: Correct the focus after choosing the directory to search
  Focus the search dialog after choosing the search directory, instead of
  focusing the view. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Fixed a problem with escape sequences where a delegate has the same as
  its parent and so the parents got overridden and was not able to
  escape the delegates end sequence. (bug #1630805) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Correctly send a ViewUpdate.ACTIVATED message when the user closes a view
  and focuses the first opened view. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fixed deep indent : now the deep indent works with the chars found in
  unalignedOpenBrackets property of the edit mode, and the matching
  end char is automatically set. (bug #1666815) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Brackets in comments or literals (in terms of token types in edit mode)
  are now ignored for indent. (SF.net bugs #747769, #1229283, #1592989)
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Encodings option pane rewritten using a JCheckBoxList, fixed the too small
  scroll amount and enabled/disabled the buttons where appropriate.

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- Plugin Manager: persistent Plugin Install Sets (1748509 - Alan Ezust)

- Plugin Manager: Option to cache PluginList for a period of minutes
    (Alan Ezust)

- Moved Encodings options out of General and into Encodings option pane.

- New View option: amount of maximum visible rows in buffer switcher
  (Patch #1642574) (Jakub Roztocil)

- The dockable panel splitter can now use continuous layout
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- The plugin manager now shows you the size of the data stored by
  each plugin that use the new plugin home folder (Matthieu Casanova)

- GeneralOptionPane - new checkbox (restore remote files on startup)
  (Alan Ezust)

- New popup menu in the plugin manager to remove plugin data when
  the plugin uses the new plugin api (Matthieu Casanova)

- New LayoutManager ExtendedGridLayout added. For further explanations see
  its JavaDoc. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- New popup menu in Register dockable panel (Matthieu Casanova)

- Removed the calls to begin- and endCompoundEdit() in macros as
  macroinvokations are always automatically embedded inside a compound
  edit. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Refactored the use of hypersearch-results.file-caption and
  hypersearch-results.result-caption to only use one property instead of three
  depending on the amount of found occurrences. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- SF Patch #1678608: Improve performace in findMatchingBracket
  Return earlier if matching bracket is unknown. (Daniel Hahler)

- Added the time in Log._log() so that events and exceptions could easier be
  assigned to interactions. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- SF Patch #1469586: Allow setting Mac OS type and creator to be optional
  Change to MacOS plugin. (Mike Gorski)

- Some HelpViewer usability fixes. Now only one node is selectable in the TOC,
  Enter key opens the selected topic, on topic changing the focus travels to
  the JEditorPane and the arrow keys can be used to scroll horizontally and
  vertically instead of moving the invisible caret which scrolls only when
  the invisible caret hits page boundaries. Additionally the history remembers
  the vertical scroll position now. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Added a new option "List of encoding autodetectors" in Encodings option pane
  to extend encoding autodetection with the new EncodingDetector services.
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Allow jEdit to autodetect :encoding= properties in the loaded buffer
  (only in the 10 first lines) by adding "buffer-local-property" to
  the new option "List of encoding autodetectors" in Encodings option pane.
  (Matthieu Casanova and Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Improved the error message of encoding errors on saving. It now shows
  the first guilty character with column number, line number and the name
  of actual encoding. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- A new action on the popup menu in the Hypersearch dockable panel to redo the
  hypersearch (Matthieu Casanova)

- When calling "line-comment" action, if the edit mode doesn't have a line
  comment property, the lines are surrounded by range comments
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Bug 1723506: Context menu key not functional on Windows
  There was no action to show the popup menu. Added one such action, and
  bound it to CONTEXT_MENU by default. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added a new option "List of fallback encodings" in Encodings option pane
  to automate trial-and-error cycle with a known set of encodings to load
  a buffer. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Glob translation to regexes got a new feature. If you start a glob now
  with the sequence "(re)" this prefix is discarded and the remaining
  string is interpreted unchanged as regex. If you need a glob starting
  with "(re)" you have to escape it and write "\(re)" instead. So now you
  can use EVERYWHERE a glob is expected a normal regex instead and use
  their full power. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

}}}
{{{ Editing

- New Edit Mode: sql-loader (David Moss)

- New edit mode: csv (jaco de groot).

- Make the auto-indent code more friendly to languages where whitespace matters
  more than usual, such as Python. A new mode property (ignoreWhitespace) was
  added, which, when false, triggers some whitespace-related indent rules. Right
  now it's tuned to Python, since I'm not familiar with other languages that
  share the same characteristics. This also fixes SF bug #1382388. There are
  some cases when some weird behavior still happens, when deep indent is
  turned on. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Applied SF Patch #1663485: perl.xml patch for variables

- Applied SF patch #1667234: clearer comments in certain parts of perl.xml

- Change the way perl "quote operators" are matched. See SF Patch #1659666
  for discussion. The fix is twofold: first, add a new "special" value for the
  end tag in SPAN_REGEXP, "~[digit]", which tries to find the matching bracket
  of the matched reference (if can't find the matching bracket, just use the tag
  body as a literal string). Second, add a new rule that highlights everything
  as "LITERAL1", used to maintain balanced brackets, and use it to highlight
  everything inside a "q" operator. This probably needs more tweaking, i.e.,
  supporting quote operators that allow interpolation, and change the other
  operators that look like "q" (such as tr). (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added some support to EL and better css and javascript coloration
  in jsp.xml (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Patch #1666690: No Undo past file save option
  Add option to reset the "undos" when a buffer is saved. (Joseph Erickson)

- SF Patch #1676041: "CamelHumps" words
  Add option to enable separating camel cased words when selecting with the
  keyboard. (Horst Eff)

- New attribute "MATCH_TYPE" that substitutes "EXCLUDE_MATCH" in mode files,
  and code to handle it in the ParserRule and TokenMarker classes. This allows
  highlighting the matched region with a different type as the rest of the
  region the rule applies to; so, for example, it's possible to use
  MARK_PREVIOUS on "foobar(" and highlight the function name as "FUNCTION" and
  the parenthesis as "OPERATOR". There are two special values for the
  attribute: "DEFAULT" is the default type for the current rule set (same
  behavior as EXCLUDE_MATCH="TRUE"), and "RULE", the default value, is the same
  type as the current rule (same as EXCLUDE_MATCH="FALSE"). This is part 1 of
  the fix for SF Bug #1658252. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- New mode for C, and refactored the C++ and Objective-C modes to take
  advantage of the new C mode. This is part 2 of the fix for
  SF Bug #1658252. (Kazutoshi Satoda and Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added an option to deactivate that rectangular selection mode
  is active if Ctrl is pressed. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

  weren't used anywhere. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- In Buffer.java, the private "mode" field was moved to JEditBuffer.java as
  a protected field. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- New IndentRule (WhitespaceRule) and new indent action (NoIncrease)
  were added. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- new method: SearchAndReplace.replaceAll(View,boolean) to do a replace all,
  but not open files that were not open before. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Buffer.getMarkersPath(VFS) deprecated and replaced by static method
  Buffer.getMarkersPath(VFS,path), see bug #1644479 (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added a new GUIUtilities.showVFSFileDialog() methods that can use a dialog
  or a Window as the browser's parent, instead of the view. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Added two new builtin service interfaces org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.Encoding
  and org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.EncodingDetector. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- MiscUtilities.isBinary(Reader) is now deprecated in favor of a new

- Added JEditTextArea.showPopupMenu(), which pops up the context menu
  at the current caret position.

  When reopening the "recent" files on startup, a buffer might fail to
  load (because, e.g., it's on a FTP server and the user canceled the
  password dialog). So ignore the buffer if it's null when restoring the
  view. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fix SF Bug #1590250: Bad EOF handling code in CBzip2InputStream
  The code seems to have other error handling problems, but at least
  now it doesn't compare a char to -1. It would be interesting to see
  what happens if we have a corrupted jar file... (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fix SF Bug #1571752: 'Add Explicit Fold' in PHP mode - wrong comments
  Be smarter when inserting explicit folds in mode boundaries by trying
  harder to use the comment characters for the mode of the text that
  is being wrapped. Also do some tweaking for when to insert new lines
  and when not to. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fix SF Bug #1594910: Indentation of Javascript embedded in HTML is broken
  The fix is more generic than what the bug suggest. The indent rules
  were being kept locally by each buffer, and reflected the "top level"
  mode's rules. So rules for sections of the buffer that were delegated
  to other modes were ignored. The fix keeps the indent rules in the mode
  instance, and the buffers retrieve the context-sensitive rules when
  applying auto-indentation. (Marcelo Vanzin)

  (Matthieu Casanova)

- MiscUtilities.moveFile(File, File) is deprecated, use
  IOUtilities.moveFile(File, File) instead (Matthieu Casanova)

- Plugin API : now the EditPlugin has two new methods :
  EditPlugin.getPluginHome() that will returns the path where the plugin
  should write it's data (it can return null if you run with nosettings).
  It is a folder build like that
  jEditSettingsDirectory/plugins/pluginClassName
  ex :
  ~/.jedit/plugins/sidekick.SidekickPlugin
  I hope this will help to make some cleanup in the jEdit settings directory folder
  (this folder is not created by jEdit, plugin developers must create it themselves)
  The second method is EditPlugin.usePluginHome()

  +, -, etc, and also underscore, are not allowed either. But since the
  regexp was still trying to be matched against such strings, it would
  have two effects: a very long pause (the "hang"), and strings like
  "y_something_something" being highlighted incorrectly. By adding a few
  extra characters to that exclusion, things seem to be much better.

- SF bug 1523117: Add explicit fold in PHP mode inserts wrong comments
  The "DEF_CLASS" rule set in the php mode file didn't have any line
  or range comments declared in the props section; so the code was now
  picking up the porperties for the default rule set, which had the
  HTML-style range comment instead of the PHP line comment. This is
  probably due to the XML parser change - the old code was probably
  propagating some property of another rule set to the DEF_CLASS rule
  set, since it used global variables for a bunch of things. So this
  might show up in other places, and might need a better fix...

- All classes using the com.microstar.xml packages have been changed to
  use JAXP to parse XML. Which means that some classes have different
  base classes now, but I don't expect anyone to be inheriting from any
  of those. Also, this means that XML parsing will be a little bit more
  "correct" now, in the sense that it will check the files against their
  DTDs (this needed some changes to the DTDs shipped with jEdit since
  some of them had errors). (Marcelo Vanzin)

- The build.xml got rebuilt to allow building the MacOS-Plugin on any platform
  and to make it easier to build the distribution files (DEB, Java-Installer,
  Mac OS X DMG, TGZ Slackware Package, Windows-Installer, SRC-package, PDF-Manuals).

{{{ Search and Replace

- HyperSearch results can now be displayed in a folder hierarchy tree
  view. This makes it easier to see file locations when there are matches
  for many different files from a deep folder structure. To activate,
  right click on the top search node in the result tree and select
  "Toggle Tree View". If multiple results is enabled, the tree view is
  only toggled for the selected search.

  There are also new context menu options for the result tree
  that only display in tree view mode when a folder node is selected.
  There are options to expand/collapse all child nodes, and another to
  exeucte a "New Search From Here", which displays the search dialog
  initialized with the path from the selected result tree folder node.

- A single-line selection no longer hides the line highlight, for
  better readability.

- The selection is now saved between buffer switches.

- ActionContext now remembers overridden actions, so another plugin
  can override builtin actions (via listing one in actions.xml with the same name).
  When the plugin is unloaded, the original action will be restored. (alan ezust)
  plugins that use this feature: infoviewer, xsearch, and optional.

  looking for prefix completions and when it was done. These
  notifications are for the ShortcutDisplay plugin.

}}}
{{{ Bug Fixes

- The following Java code did not indent properly:

  if(foo)
  {
      foo(bar,
          baz);
  }

- The following Java code did not indent properly:

  foo(bar(
          <--- should not have two levels of indent here

- The soft wrap state is no longer reset when a buffer is saved. This
  was pointless and slowed down the editor.

- Screen line management had an off-by-one error, so in some situations
  the vertical scroll bar state would become inconsistent.

- Registers dockable window had a few problems (Nicholas O'Leary).

- Word count would show -1 for an empty buffer (Michael Macnair).

- Fixed corrupted cursor image problem on Mac OS X.

- Complete word popup is now always positioned within the screen bounds.

- The last physical line index was not updated when saving files
  sometimes, resulting in exceptions when clicking in the text area.

- If rectangular selection mode was enabled and you clicked beyond the
  end of the line in a read-only buffer, jEdit would beep.

- Using 'Delete Lines' with folding could mess up the vertical scroll
  bar.

- File system browser's right click menu now contains the "Plugins" menu
  (Nicholas O'Leary).

- Fixed file system browser's left arrow key behavior (David Chan).

- The startup script created by the Java-based installer on Mac OS X now
  adds the Cocoa classes to jEdit's class path, so the Mac OS plugin
  should work with no further tweaking.

- Fix race condition when there were buffers in the perspective, as well
  as buffers specified to open on the command line.

- If windows were docked in the top docking area, the action bar would
  display in the wrong place.

- After receiving a PropertiesChanged on EditBus, the PluginManager will
  check if the mirror was changed before updating the plugin list
  (Matthieu Casanova).

{{{ API Changes

- bug  1386702: DockableWindowManager now sends an EditBus message
        DockableWindowUpdate.ACTIVATED when a dockable is activated.
        And a corresponding DEACTIVATED message when it is deactivated. (alan ezust)

-  A new EditBus message has been introduced: EditPaneUpdate.CHANGING
        for Navigator (or other EBPlugins) to catch caret positions
        just before buffers are changed.  (Alan ezust)

-  A new EditBus message has been introduced: BufferUpdate.CLOSING
        for EBPlugins to catch events just before buffers are closed.
		(Alan ezust)

- Selecting multiple directories in the file chooser dialog box is now
  supported; just pass true as the last parameter (Matthieu Casanova):

  GUIUtilities.showVFSFileDialog(view,null,
    VFSBrowser.CHOOSE_DIRECTORY_DIALOG,true)

- Now that the text area is independent of the rest of jEdit, various
  text area-related APIs that used to take org.gjt.sp.jedit.Buffer
  instances now take org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.JEditBuffers:

  - BufferChangeListener and BufferChangeAdapter are now deprecated. Use
    BufferListener instead.

  - FoldHandler.getFoldLevel() now takes a JEditBuffer as a parameter.

  - VFS.copy() methods added (Matthieu Casanova).

  - MiscUtilities.copyStream() and MiscUtilities.closeQuietly() methods
    added (Matthieu Casanova).

{{{ Version 4.3pre2

Thanks to Bertalan Fodor, Dirk Moebius. Jarek Tuszynski, Joshua Gertzen,
Nicholas O'Leary, and Simon Ruggier for contributing to this release.

{{{ Auto Indent

- The auto indent engine has been rewritten from scratch to provide
  more accurate indentation for a variety of languages, including Java,
  Common Lisp, and Factor.

- Aligned bracket indent is done as before with "indentOpenBrackets" and
  "indentCloseBrackets" properties. Unaligned indent was previously
  enabled by setting "lineUpClosingBrackets" to "false". Now, you must
  specify "unalignedOpenBrackets" and "unalignedCloseBrackets"
  properties.

  The upside is that both aligned and unaligned indent can be used in
  the same edit mode. For example, in Java source, the following piece
  of code is indented correctly:

  public void apply(Buffer buffer, int thisLineIndex,
          int prevLineIndex, int prevPrevLineIndex,
          List indentActions)
  {
          // ...
  }

- The new "unindentThisLine" property, whose value is a regexp, allows
  indentation of Java switch/case constructs:

  switch(foo) {
  case bar:
          hello();
  default:
          yo();
  }

- In order to immediately re-indent the line as soon as the case or
  default statement is terminated with a :, the "electricKeys" property
  is set to a list of characters whose input triggers a re-indent of the
  current line.

- The new "unindentNextLines" property, whose value is a regexp,  allows
  indentation of Factor colon definitions -- in particular, after the ;
  everything must be unindented:

  : refers? ( to obj -- ? )
      f swap [ pick eq? or ] each-slot nip ;
  ! Indent returns here

{{{ Syntax Highlighting

- Updated LilyPond syntax highlighting (Bertalan Fodor).

- Rd syntax highlighting (Jarek Tuszynski).

- Updated ASP syntax highlighting (Simon Ruggier).

- Slate (http://slate.tunes.org) syntax highlighting.

}}}
{{{ File System Browser

- The file system now lazily retreives file system attributes. For
  plugins that use the VFS API, this has important implications; see
  the below "API Changes" section. (Joshua Gertzen).

- Previously, file system browser columns would resize to fit all the
  attributes of all visible files. Now, this is not possible, so instead
  columns can be resized manually and their size is preserved.

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- When an item from the "Paste Previous" or "Paste Deleted" dialog boxes
  is inserted, it is moved to the top of the list.

- Pasting now preserves the tall caret.

- New text areas viewing a buffer inherit the fold visibility map from a
  previous text area.

- The right-click popup for HyperSearch results nodes has three new
  entries:

  - Open
  - Open in New View
  - Open in New Plain View
  - Open in New Split

- On Mac OS X, the close box is shown with a different appearance if a
  visible buffer has unsaved changes.

- Dropping text into the text area now selects it (Nicholas O'Leary).

- The cursor is hidden when you start typing.

- Renamed 'Delete Line' to 'Delete Lines'; now does the right thing if
  more than one line is selected. Same for 'Join Lines' versus
  'Join Line'.

- When the search bar loses focus, the currently entered text is added
  to the history.

- "Format Paragraph" now preserves the caret position.

}}}
{{{ Bug Fixes

- Fix NullPointerException in file system roots list.

- Search and replace dialog's "Search subdirectories" checkbox did not
  have an Alt-key mnemonic.

- Binding actions to numeric keypad keys should now work better.

- Pressing something like A+f l where A+f was a prefix but A+f l was
  not bound would insert l into the buffer, which was undesirable.

- The plugin manager did not select a plugin's dependencies when the
  plugin was selected for installation.

- Invoking 'Expand Fold' when the fold is expanded would move the caret
  to the wrong place.

- Changing the wrap mode didn't update screen line counts, causing
  various problems.

- The custom history text field border with the popup widget is back.

- Fixed a memory leak. Token markers were retaining the line segment
  they were given to tokenize -- in some cases, this line segment could
  hang around for a while, and was huge.

- Fix performance regression when deleting text; too many lines were
  being repainted.

- 'Cut Append' and 'Copy Append' commands did not update the Registers
  dockable.

- Fix Control key on Mac OS X.

- Changing the font size did not update the vertical scrollbar.

- JSwat plugin did not work when running under Java 5 due to a bug in
  jEdit's JARClassLoader (Dirk Moebius).

- Fix some problems with paths that end with multiple file separators.

- Inserting a long line of text did not always scroll horizontally as
  required.

- Split panes now have resize weight, ensuring more intuitive behavior
  when a split view is resized.

- If autosave kicked in while the 'Close All Buffers' dialog was open,
  then the perspective would be saved, and the wrong buffer would be
  restored on the next startup.

- Fix an exception from being shown when loading a file with a malformed
  .marks file.

- Fix possible ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when deleting text after
  decreasing the number of history elements.

- Double clicking the middle mouse button now pastes twice, instead of
  pasting and selecting a word.

}}}
{{{ API Changes

- View.updateTitle() is now public.

- VFS.DirectoryEntry has been deprecated because its interface is not
  conductive to lazy initialization. Virtual file systems should now
  return instances of org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFSFile, and instead of
  reading/writing the public fields of that class (they are public but
  deprecated for VFS.DirectoryEntry compatibility), you should call the
  accessor/mutator methods.

- A new MiscUtilities.pathsEqual() method has been added to check for
  equality of path names while ignoring case sensitivity on Windows.

{{{ Search and Replace

- When invoking "Find", "Incremental Search for Word" or "HyperSearch
  for Word" actions, if regular expression search is on, any special
  characters in the selection are automatically escaped.

- Find dialog box now has fields that accept multi-line input. Pressing
  ENTER activates the "Find" button; press C+ENTER to insert lines in

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- jEdit no longer runs with Java 2 version 1.3. Java 2 version 1.4 or
  1.5 is now required.

- If the wrap margin is set to 0 and soft wrap is enabled, wrapping is
  now performed at the text area width. This used to be in 4.1, but
  got removed in 4.2, and now its back due to popular demand.

- Rename Autosave & Backup option pane to Save & Backup, move some
  options from General pane there (Marcelo Vanzin).

- Added Ant target for building a MacOS X .app package (Trevor Harmon).

- Added Register and Marker dockables (Nicholas O'Leary).

- "Rectangular Selection" command now changes the state of the current
  selection to match the flag.

- "Select All" preserves current scroll position.

- When closing jEdit, open buffers are not added to the "Recent Files"
  list if the "Restore previously open files on startup" option is on.

- View.goToBuffer() will try to find a non-zero height text area if
  possible.

- Pressing TAB now preserves the tall caret, if there is one.

- When a directory is reloaded, it is no longer moved to the top of the
  file system browser's history list.

- Added View->Splitting->Restore Split action -- it recreates a
  split pane configuration as it was before the most recent 'Unsplit'.

{{{ Bug Fixes

- "Backup directory" feature now works if the file being edited is on a
  different filesystem than the backup directory (Marcelo Vanzin).

- Don't use two-stage save if the file's parent directory is not
  writeable (Marcelo Vanzin).

- Minor fix for handling of the recent buffer when the current buffer
  was closed.

- Fix StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when opening files with a
  malformed XML PI.

- Removing open files from the favorites list didn't work.

- calling readNextChar() no longer clears the status bar after the
  script returns.

- Fix potential ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when indenting lines
  containing unmatched brackets.

- The "deselecting this plugin will deselect dependencies" message did
  not give the actual list of dependencies.

- Fixed NullPointerException when selecting QuickNotepad menu items
  before opening QuickNotepad first.

- Register persistence was broken and didn't work in many cases.
