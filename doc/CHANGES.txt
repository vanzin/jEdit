{{{ Bug Fixes

- A minor bug of cursor changing when dragging dockable panels
  using non continuous layout (Matthieu Casanova)

- special characters in file:// URLs passed on to jEdit.openFile()
  were not being properly decoded (1663617).

- 1667659 - Fix for FTP I/O regression in 4.3pre9 (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- HyperSearch Results does not lose focus on enter (Bug 1260023,
  Patch 1646058) (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- In the logviewer if the tail checkbox is on,
  the last line was not visible after resizing the panel
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- Autoreload buffer without notification was not available in
  General option pane (bug #1641997) (Matthieu Casanova)

- When saving a buffer, if the encoding is unsupported,
  an error dialog appears (Matthieu Casanova)

- A bug when loading a plugin the dependency check had errors :
  for example when you have Sidekick, JavaSidekick and another plugin
  that requires Sidekick (PHPParser, XML ...)
  in your jar folder, all unloaded, try to load the third one,
  the dependency check will try to load JavaSidekick instead of
  Sidekick (Matthieu Casanova)

- VFSBrowser.filesActivated() - passed proper View to jEdit.openFile()
  from FSB open action (Alan Ezust).

- Escape char ignored in some edit modes (bug #1630805)
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- Bug #1649695: jEdit shell script doesn't handle spaces in filenames
  (Nicholas O'Leary)

- Macro Single_Space_Buffer was broken (#1525313) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Scrolling up broken after content removing (#1584436) (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Patch #1663901: Improve performance in TokenMarker.handleRule()
  Daniel Hahler reported that jProfiler found some unoptimized code in
  TokenMarker.handleRule(). Instead of applying his patch directly, I
  implemented another approach and also took care of the other case
  of allocating a new string to do a comparison. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF Patch #1656225: Disable encoding auto detection which overrides a selection
  When reloading a file with a specific encoding or changing the encoding in
  the buffer options, disable encoding auto-detection for the buffer.
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- SF Bug #1664900: Auto-indent breaks if previous line is a single line indent
  The "collapse" action used as a hint for the OpenBracketIndentRule needs to
  differentiate between the actions being triggered by code in the previous
  line or by code in the "previous previous" line. This way, for example, a
  "for" declared after an "if" that didn't use brackets will, correctly, not
  be indented one level below the if. See the bug for more "graphical"
  depictions. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Some bugfixes and improvements to ExtendedGridLayout. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed that files were shown in VFSBrowser in choose directory mode.
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Saving a buffer to another VFS was not working (some bugs with markers)
  (#1644479) (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Bug #1668893: Wrong conversion to UTF-16 (with BOM)
  A previous change of mine trying to fix another UTF-16 issue actually
  implemented the reverse of what the spec says: UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE don't
  have a BOM, while UTF-16 needs a BOM at the start. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF Patch #1649033: Correct the focus after choosing the directory to search
  Focus the search dialog after choosing the search directory, instead of
  focusing the view. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- New View option: # of max visible rows in buffer switcher
  (Patch 1642574 - Jakub  Roztocil )

- The dockable panel splitter can now use continuous layout
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- The plugin manager now shows you the size of the datas stored by
  each plugin that use the new plugin home folder (Matthieu Casanova)

- GeneralOptionPane - new checkbox (restore remote files on startup)
  (Alan Ezust).

- New popup menu in the plugin manager to remove plugin datas when
  the plugin uses the new plugin api (Matthieu Casanova)

- Option to allow jEdit to autodetect :encoding= properties in the loaded
  buffer (only in the 10 first lines) (Matthieu Casanova)

- New LayoutManager ExtendedGridLayout added. For further explanations see
  its JavaDoc. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- New popup menu in Register dockable panel (Matthieu Casanova)

}}}
{{{ Editing

- New edit mode: csv (jaco de groot).

- Make the auto-indent code more friendly to languages where whitespace matters
  more than usual, such as Python. A new mode property (ignoreWhitespace) was
  added, which, when false, triggers some whitespace-related indent rules. Right
  now it's tuned to Python, since I'm not familiar with other languages that
  share the same characteristics. This also fixes SF bug #1382388. There are
  some cases when some weird behavior still happens, when deep indent is
  turned on. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Applied SF Patch #1663485: perl.xml patch for variables

- Applied SF patch #1667234: clearer comments in certain parts of perl.xml

- Change the way perl "quote operators" are matched. See SF Patch #1659666
  for discussion. The fix is twofold: first, add a new "special" value for the
  end tag in SPAN_REGEXP, "~[digit]", which tries to find the matching bracket
  of the matched reference (if can't find the matching bracket, just use the tag
  body as a literal string). Second, add a new rule that highlights everything
  as "LITERAL1", used to maintain balanced brackets, and use it to highlight
  everything inside a "q" operator. This probably needs more tweaking, i.e.,
  supporting quote operators that allow interpolation, and change the other
  operators that look like "q" (such as tr). (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added some support to EL and better css and javascript coloration
  in jsp.xml (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF Patch #1666690: No Undo past file save option
  Add option to reset the "undos" when a buffer is saved. (Joseph Erickson)

- SF Patch #1676041: "CamelHumps" words
  Add option to enable separating camel cased words when selecting with the
  keyboard. (Horst Eff)

- New attribute "MATCH_TYPE" that substitutes "EXCLUDE_MATCH" in mode files,
  and code to handle it in the ParserRule and TokenMarker classes. This allows
  highlighting the matched region with a different type as the rest of the
  region the rule applies to; so, for example, it's possible to use
  MARK_PREVIOUS on "foobar(" and highlight the function name as "FUNCTION" and
  the parenthesis as "OPERATOR". There are two special values for the
  attribute: "DEFAULT" is the default type for the current rule set (same
  behavior as EXCLUDE_MATCH="TRUE"), and "RULE", the default value, is the same
  type as the current rule (same as EXCLUDE_MATCH="FALSE"). This is part 1 of
  the fix for SF Bug #1658252. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- New mode for C, and refactored the C++ and Objective-C modes to take
  advantage of the new C mode. This is part 2 of the fix for
  SF Bug #1658252. (Kazutoshi Satoda and Marcelo Vanzin)


}}}
{{{ API Changes

- VFS.isMarkersFileSupported() added to give a VFS the chance to tell
  jEdit that no markers file should be saved or loaded to/from this VFS.
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Deprecated VFS.showBrowseDialog() as it is not used in the jEdit core anymore,
  so it doesn't have to be provided anymore. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Removed class VFSBrowser.PluginsMenuButton.ActionHandler as it isn't used
  anymore. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- New static method EditPlugin.getPluginHome(Class<? extends EditPlugin>)
  that will return the path where a plugin should store it's data and
  replaces the EditPlugin.getPluginHome() introduced in 4.3pre9.
  It can be null if running without settings (Matthieu Casanova)

- New method IOUtilities.fileLength() that computes a file or directory length
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- GUIUtilities.centerOnScreen() method is deprecated, use
  javax.swing.JWindow#setLocationRelativeTo(java.awt.Component) instead
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- plugin.className.files added as property for plugins. This property specifies
  external non-JAR files, e. g. libraries, which are in the jars directory.
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- ParserRule.hashChar and ParserRule.hashChars have been removed, since they
  weren't used anywhere. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- In Buffer.java, the private "mode" field was moved to JEditBuffer.java as
  a protected field. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- New IndentRule (WhitespaceRule) and new indent action (NoIncrease)
  were added. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- new method: SearchAndReplace.replaceAll(View,boolean) to do a replace all,
  but not open files that were not open before. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Buffer.getMarkersPath(VFS) deprecated and replaced by static method
  Buffer.getMarkersPath(VFS,path), see bug #1644479 (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added a new GUIUtilities.showVFSFileDialog() method that can use a dialog as
  the browser's parent, instead of the view. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

{{{ Bug Fixes

- avoid NPE from getIndentRules (patch #1611766) (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- bufferio operations are now exception-safe (patch #1597168) (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Encoding errors properly reported on save (patch #1601830) (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Filter Box lose focus bug (patch #1608948) (kuljc)

- Fixed the broken quick copy behaviour (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed the wrong text in SearchAndReplace Dialog (bug #1592529)
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed wrong highlighting of multiline strings in cobol editmode
  (bug #785290) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Plugins in plugins options are now sorted case-insentively
  (bug #1593410) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed the not resolved IMPORTs in IMPORTs (bug #1569735)
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fix SF Bug #1596756: Annoying problem with file system browser in 4.3pre7
  When reopening the "recent" files on startup, a buffer might fail to
  load (because, e.g., it's on a FTP server and the user canceled the
  password dialog). So ignore the buffer if it's null when restoring the
  view. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fix SF Bug #1590250: Bad EOF handling code in CBzip2InputStream
  The code seems to have other error handling problems, but at least
  now it doesn't compare a char to -1. It would be interesting to see
  what happens if we have a corrupted jar file... (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fix SF Bug #1571752: 'Add Explicit Fold' in PHP mode - wrong comments
  Be smarter when inserting explicit folds in mode boundaries by trying
  harder to use the comment characters for the mode of the text that
  is being wrapped. Also do some tweaking for when to insert new lines
  and when not to. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fix SF Bug #1594910: Indentation of Javascript embedded in HTML is broken
  The fix is more generic than what the bug suggest. The indent rules
  were being kept locally by each buffer, and reflected the "top level"
  mode's rules. So rules for sections of the buffer that were delegated
  to other modes were ignored. The fix keeps the indent rules in the mode
  instance, and the buffers retrieve the context-sensitive rules when
  applying auto-indentation. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- When deactivating a plugin if the VFS Browser was open but it's menubar
  disabled, a NPE occured (#1593392) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed a bug I introduced with the new HASH_CHAR handling
  (bug #1600380) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed another bug with the new HASH_CHAR handling
  (bug #1600401) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed precedence of Recent Files List caretposition over commandline
  supplied caret position (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- SearchMatcher in SearchAndReplace cannot match empty Strings anymore
  (#1601718) (Matthieu Casanova)

- If you use two stage save and your file is writeable but in a folder
  where you cannot write, a dialog will ask you if you want to save using
  normal method (#1609303) (Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed that ESCAPE sequence of RULES tag couldn't appear at the beginning
  of a rule. Now this is possible. Also added documentation about the
  ESCAPE attribute. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Hypersearch now report occurences count and line count (#1565447)
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- Several exceptions fixed in plugin manager after update or remove plugins
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- When simplified keyboard handling was off, typing Alt+F o to open
  a file, the o was also written in the textarea. (#1593359) (Matthieu Casanova)

- VariableGridLayout resized Components to sizes bigger than their maximum size,
  now it resizes it only up to its maximum size and positions the Components
  according to their alignmentX/alignmentY values if the cell is bigger than
  the Component's size. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Horizontal scrollbar in the textarea was not always updated
  (#1534016, #1617483) (Matthieu Casanova)

- In hypersearch when switching to flat nodes, the full path is displayed
  correctly (#1593523) (Matthieu Casanova)

- The VFS Browser filter was not working as expected
  (#1617509) (Matthieu Casanova)

  (Matthieu Casanova)

- When closing an untitled buffer is is removed from the CaretInfo map
  of the EditPanes (Matthieu Casanova)

  (Matthieu Casanova)

- The Files change dialog has now an ignore button to set the
  autoreload and autoreloaddialog flags to false (Matthieu Casanova)

- VariableGridLayout, two new capabilities: it can
  take minimum and maximum sizes of a Component into account when
  distributing free space and you can supply distances to the borders
  of the Container. The new capabilites are useable by the two new
  constructors. For more information, see the JavaDoc documentation.
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Reload/ReloadAll now ignores buffers with the NEW_FILE flag set. This

}}}
{{{ API Changes

- Refactored the manually implemented HashSet of LinkedLists to use the
  Java Collections HashSet and ArrayList. Therefore the ParserRule.next
  and the ParserRuleSet.getRules(char) got deprecated in favor of
  ParserRuleSet.getRules(Character) (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Deprecated JEditBuffer.isElectricKey(char).
  Added JEditBuffer.isElectricKey(char, int) to replace it.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Deprecated some of the ParserRule.createXXX() methods which accepted
  only one character HASH_CHAR, while introduced new ones that accept
  whole Strings. Additionally new ones for accepting HASH_CHARS got
  added. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- SearchDialog.preloadSearchDialog(View) is deprecated, this is
  not necessary on our big computers and JVM with JIT (Matthieu Casanova)

- VariableGridLayout has two new constructors to use the new capabilites.
  For more information see section Miscellaneous. (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- PluginManager.getPluginList() is not public anymore. It was not useful
  since the PluginList class cannot be accessed outside of it's package
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- MiscUtilities.moveFile(File, File) is deprecated, use
  IOUtilities.moveFile(File, File) instead (Matthieu Casanova)

- Plugin API : now the EditPlugin has two new methods :
  EditPlugin.getPluginHome() that will returns the path where the plugin
  should write it's data (it can return null if you run with nosettings).
  It is a folder build like that
  jEditSettingsDirectory/plugins/pluginClassName
  ex :
  ~/.jedit/plugins/sidekick.SidekickPlugin
  I hope this will help to make some cleanup in the jEdit settings directory folder
  (this folder is not created by jEdit, plugin developers must create it themselves)
  The second method is EditPlugin.usePluginHome()
  that plugin developers should overload to tell jEdit if they use this new folder
  The default is false (Matthieu Casanova)

- VFSFile.getIcon() and VFSFile.getDefaultIcon(). The getIcon() method
  can be override to use a custom icon for some VFS (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.PropertiesChanging; an EditBus message that is
  sent right before the global options dialog is shown, to allow plugins to
  flush any data that might be used by the option panes.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- OptionsDialog.init(String,String) was made protected (was private).
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- New GUIUtilities.initContinuousLayout(JSplitPane) method that will
  init the JSplitPane with the appearance.continuousLayout property.
  It can be used by plugins that has JSplitPane when receiving a PropertiesChanged

- DockableWindowManager.closeListener(String dockableName) - a new
  convenience method for creating keyboard listeners for floating
  dockables to respond to the "close-current-area" action. (Alan Ezust)

- GUIUtilities.addSizeSaver(Frame frame, String name) added to
  save a Frames size and position correctly, even if it gets

- Ability to clear the Recent Files List from menu (Matthieu Casanova)

- Beanshell 2.0b4 bundled (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added an OptionPane "Encodings" to select which encodings to
  show in encoding dialogs.  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Improved DockableWindowManager.closeCurrentArea() - closes more
  docked dockables than it did before. (Alan Ezust)

- Fixed the storing of Frame size and position
  if the Frame gets maximized. (bug #1325358)
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed VFS.copy() method when the returned session is null
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- When adding explicit folds, and using a line comment for the end line,
  insert a line break after the fold end if the line is not empty,
  avoiding commenting out existing code. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added option to not print collapsed folds. (Nicholas O'Leary)

- Added paste and clear buttons to the Registers dockable.
  (Nicholas O'Leary)

- The behavior of JARClassLoader now is different than in previous
  versions of jEdit. JARClassLoader will now delegate class loading
  to the parent class loader before looking in its cache. This means
  that, by default, plugins can't override classes in the JVM's
  boot classpath. The behavior is configurable on a per-plugin
  basis (see javadoc for details). This fixes SF Bug #1509218.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF Bug #1527824: Perl Syntax Highlighting hangs 4.3pre6
  More activity on my favorite edit mode. :-)
  The [^\p{Alpha}\p{Space}] rule at the start of Perl's "y/.../" syntax
  was not entirely correct; some other characters, mainly operators like
  +, -, etc, and also underscore, are not allowed either. But since the
  regexp was still trying to be matched against such strings, it would
  have two effects: a very long pause (the "hang"), and strings like
  "y_something_something" being highlighted incorrectly. By adding a few
  extra characters to that exclusion, things seem to be much better.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

{{{ Bug Fixes

- (jedit-Bugs-1518537) FSB keyboard handling bugs fixed.
  Arrow keys, backspace, and return all do sensible things

- (jedit-bugs 1533925) Alpha-numerics are no longer being "passed through"
  from the FSB to the editpane.  (Alan Ezust)

- SF bug 1526487: ArrayOutOfBoundException in VFS Browser. (Matthieu Casanova)

- SF bug 1519237: Regular Expression Search in 4.3pre5
  regexp search should be done with Pattern.MULTILINE enabled, otherwise
  ^ and $ will only match the start and end of the buffer. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF bug 1517395: Wrong character encoding in killring.xml
  fix bug in Java 1.5 by saving ASCII control characters as character
  entities; since 1.4 doesn't support XML 1.1, if killring.xml has
  character entities it will fail (so the bug will still be there
  when running on 1.4). (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF bug 1523261: "Regular expression " and "Ignore case"
  There was a stray "flags" variable in PatternSearchMatcher.nextMatch()
  that was clobbering the instance variable with the same name (that
  actually contained the needed flags for the compiled pattern).
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- SF bug 1523117: Add explicit fold in PHP mode inserts wrong comments
  The "DEF_CLASS" rule set in the php mode file didn't have any line
  or range comments declared in the props section; so the code was now
  picking up the porperties for the default rule set, which had the
  HTML-style range comment instead of the PHP line comment. This is
  probably due to the XML parser change - the old code was probably
  propagating some property of another rule set to the DEF_CLASS rule
  set, since it used global variables for a bunch of things. So this
  might show up in other places, and might need a better fix...

{{{ Reinstall required
- Gnu.regexp is no longer used by jEdit, in favor of java.util.regex
  Since the regexp removal has also affected the modes handling and thus
  the files in the "modes" directory, just updating "jedit.jar" of an
  existing jEdit installation does not suffice. You would get weird
  errors in this case. Thus, a full reinstall is required.

{{{ Keyboard handling changes
- There is a new option, "simplified keyboard handling"
  under "general options" to switch between two keyboard handling modes.
  Keyboard event workaround handling has been substantially changed (as
  a fix to bug 1488047). This may greatly affect the way your keys work.
  Please report any bugs regarding this (and please drop a note about
  this bug in bug 1488047).

{{{ API Changes

- DockableWindowManager has a new method, setDockableTitle()
  which allows you to set the string in the title bar
  for floating dockables. Now docked buttons use the dockableName.label
  property instead of the .title. This way, we can have have long titles
  in the floater, and short strings on the dock button. (Alan Ezust)

- Macros.Macro.invoke() has been rewritten to begin the compoundEdit on the buffer that is
  active buffer before the macro gets invoked, and end the compoundEdit on the buffer that is active
  after the macro is invoked opposed to end the compoundEdit on the buffer it was started on.
  JEditTextArea.setBuffer() has been rewritten to end a compoundEdit on the old buffer and start
  a new compoundEdit on the new buffer if there were a compoundEdit in progress.
  (bug #1469996).   (Björn "Vampire" Kautler )

- New class: org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.CaretChanging, for alerting
  other plugins that the caret position is about to change.
  This allows Navigator to be alerted of sidekick selections. (Alan
  Ezust)

- MiscUtilities.isBinaryFile() method that will check if a file is binary or not (Matthieu Casanova)

- MiscUtilities.autodetect() this method tries to autodetect the file encoding. It was moved
  from BufferIORequest (Matthieu Casanova)

- New utility class : IOUtilities that will contains static IO methods that
  depends only on JDK. (Matthieu Casanova)

- New utility class : StandardUtilities that will contains static
  methods that depends only on JDK (Matthieu Casanova)

- jEditBuffer.getRegexProperty() has been removed;
  jEditBuffer.getPatternProperty() was added to replace it.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- MiscUtilities.quickSort() methods and MiscUtilities.Compare class are now deprecated
	use Arrays.sort() and Collections.sort() (Matthieu Casanova)

- MiscUtilities.parseXML() and MiscUtilities.findEntity() were added.
  They're mainly used internally to ease XML parsing, but can safely
  be used by other people. Please refer to the javadoc documentation
  about how these methods operate. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- org.gjt.sp.jedit.search.RESearchMatcher has been removed as part
  of the gnu.regexp removal; it didn't make sense to write extra
  code to keep that class working. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- due to the change to support java.util.regex, the signature for
  org.gjt.sp.jedit.search.SearchMatcher.nextMatch() has changed.
  This means that any plugin that uses SearchMatcher or one of its
  implementations directly will break. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added Log.log(urgency, source, message, exception). (Xuân Baldauf)

{{{ Miscellaneous
- SearchReplace dialog now supports additional options,
  for Directory Search: "skipHidden" and "skipBinary".

- When saving a file with .gz extension the buffer is gzipped (it was not working when using two stage save.)
  It also remove GZIPPED property if the buffer name was ending with .gz and is not anymore
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- All classes using the gnu.regexp packages have been changed to use
  java.util.regexp. This needed some refactoring of a few components
  inside the syntax highlighting and search subsystems. This means
  that mode files using regexps and searches now should use the
  java.util.regex syntax instead of the old syntax.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- All classes using the com.microstar.xml packages have been changed to
  use JAXP to parse XML. Which means that some classes have different
  base classes now, but I don't expect anyone to be inheriting from any
  of those. Also, this means that XML parsing will be a little bit more
  "correct" now, in the sense that it will check the files against their
  DTDs (this needed some changes to the DTDs shipped with jEdit since
  some of them had errors). (Marcelo Vanzin)

- The build.xml got rebuilt to allow building the MacOS-Plugin on any platform
  and to make it easier to build the distribution files (DEB, Java-Installer,
  Mac OS X DMG, TGZ Slackware Package, Windows-Installer, SRC-package, PDF-Manuals).

{{{ Version 4.3pre2

Thanks to Bertalan Fodor, Dirk Moebius. Jarek Tuszynski, Joshua Gertzen,
Nicholas O'Leary, and Simon Ruggier for contributing to this release.

{{{ Auto Indent

- The auto indent engine has been rewritten from scratch to provide
  more accurate indentation for a variety of languages, including Java,
  Common Lisp, and Factor.

- Aligned bracket indent is done as before with "indentOpenBrackets" and
  "indentCloseBrackets" properties. Unaligned indent was previously
  enabled by setting "lineUpClosingBrackets" to "false". Now, you must
  specify "unalignedOpenBrackets" and "unalignedCloseBrackets"
  properties.

  The upside is that both aligned and unaligned indent can be used in
  the same edit mode. For example, in Java source, the following piece
  of code is indented correctly:

  public void apply(Buffer buffer, int thisLineIndex,
          int prevLineIndex, int prevPrevLineIndex,
          List indentActions)
  {
          // ...
  }

- The new "unindentThisLine" property, whose value is a regexp, allows
  indentation of Java switch/case constructs:

  switch(foo) {
  case bar:
          hello();
  default:
          yo();
  }

- In order to immediately re-indent the line as soon as the case or
  default statement is terminated with a :, the "electricKeys" property
  is set to a list of characters whose input triggers a re-indent of the
  current line.

- The new "unindentNextLines" property, whose value is a regexp,  allows
  indentation of Factor colon definitions -- in particular, after the ;
  everything must be unindented:

  : refers? ( to obj -- ? )
      f swap [ pick eq? or ] each-slot nip ;
  ! Indent returns here

  previous text area.

- The right-click popup for HyperSearch results nodes has three new
  entries:

  - Open
  - Open in New View
  - Open in New Plain View
  - Open in New Split

- On Mac OS X, the close box is shown with a different appearance if a
  visible buffer has unsaved changes.

- Dropping text into the text area now selects it (Nicholas O'Leary).

- The cursor is hidden when you start typing.

- Renamed 'Delete Line' to 'Delete Lines'; now does the right thing if
  more than one line is selected. Same for 'Join Lines' versus
  'Join Line'.

- When the search bar loses focus, the currently entered text is added

- Binding actions to numeric keypad keys should now work better.

- Pressing something like A+f l where A+f was a prefix but A+f l was
  not bound would insert l into the buffer, which was undesirable.

- The plugin manager did not select a plugin's dependencies when the
  plugin was selected for installation.

- Invoking 'Expand Fold' when the fold is expanded would move the caret
  to the wrong place.

- Changing the wrap mode didn't update screen line counts, causing

- The custom history text field border with the popup widget is back.

- Fixed a memory leak. Token markers were retaining the line segment
  they were given to tokenize -- in some cases, this line segment could

  deprecated for VFS.DirectoryEntry compatibility), you should call the
  accessor/mutator methods.

- A new MiscUtilities.pathsEqual() method has been added to check for
  equality of path names while ignoring case sensitivity on Windows.

{{{ Version 4.3pre1

Thanks to Cameron Morrison, Igor Lesik, Jim Lawton, Marcelo Vanzin,
Nicholas O'Leary and Trevor Harmon for contributing to this release.

{{{ Search and Replace

- When invoking "Find", "Incremental Search for Word" or "HyperSearch
  for Word" actions, if regular expression search is on, any special
  characters in the selection are automatically escaped.

- Find dialog box now has fields that accept multi-line input. Pressing
  ENTER activates the "Find" button; press C+ENTER to insert lines in
  the field.

- Variables such as "view", "buffer" and "textArea" can now be used from
  BeanShell replace expressions.

}}}
{{{ Syntax Highlighting

- Literate Haskell syntax highlighting (Cameron Morrison).

- Updated D syntax highlighting (Jim Lawton).

- Forth syntax highlighting.

- Motorola 68000 assembler syntax highlighting (Igor Lesik).

}}}
{{{ Scripting

- Macros written in the UTF-8Y and UTF-16 encodings are auto-detected.

- Added Macros->Repeat Last Macro command. This used to be in 4.1, but
  got removed in 4.2, and now its back due to popular demand.

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- jEdit no longer runs with Java 2 version 1.3. Java 2 version 1.4 or
  1.5 is now required.

- If the wrap margin is set to 0 and soft wrap is enabled, wrapping is
  now performed at the text area width. This used to be in 4.1, but
  got removed in 4.2, and now its back due to popular demand.

- Rename Autosave & Backup option pane to Save & Backup, move some
  options from General pane there (Marcelo Vanzin).

- Added Ant target for building a MacOS X .app package (Trevor Harmon).

- Added Register and Marker dockables (Nicholas O'Leary).

- "Rectangular Selection" command now changes the state of the current
  selection to match the flag.

- "Select All" preserves current scroll position.

- When closing jEdit, open buffers are not added to the "Recent Files"
  list if the "Restore previously open files on startup" option is on.

- View.goToBuffer() will try to find a non-zero height text area if
  possible.

- Pressing TAB now preserves the tall caret, if there is one.

- When a directory is reloaded, it is no longer moved to the top of the
  file system browser's history list.

- Added View->Splitting->Restore Split action -- it recreates a
  split pane configuration as it was before the most recent 'Unsplit'.

}}}
{{{ Bug Fixes

- "Backup directory" feature now works if the file being edited is on a
  different filesystem than the backup directory (Marcelo Vanzin).

- Don't use two-stage save if the file's parent directory is not
  writeable (Marcelo Vanzin).

- Minor fix for handling of the recent buffer when the current buffer
  was closed.

- Fix StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when opening files with a
  malformed XML PI.

- calling readNextChar() no longer clears the status bar after the
  script returns.

- Fix potential ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when indenting lines
  containing unmatched brackets.

  not give the actual list of dependencies.

  before opening QuickNotepad first.

- Register persistence was broken and didn't work in many cases.

}}}
