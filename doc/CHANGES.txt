{{{ Version 5.0pre1

Thanks to Björn "Vampire" Kautler, Nathan Gray, Evan Wright, Alan Ezust,
Matthieu Casanova and Jarek Czekalski for contributing to this release.

{{{ Bug fixes

- When parsing buffer-local properties, there was a problem with escape
  processing that prevented buffer-local properties to be read sometimes
  (Bug #3438680 - Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Building offline was prevented by a bug in Ivy, this is workarounded
  now in the Ivy settings for jEdit. (Bug #3437212 - Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Fixed #3163058: middle mouse button paste doesn't respect gutter selection.
  (Shlomy Reinstein)

- ":encoding=...:" was treated as buffer local property and caused
  confusion about what encoding was used at loading/saving the buffer.
  (SF.net patch #3434651 - Jarek Czekalski, for bug #1643580)
  
- Several message boxes were not being created on the EDT which would result in
  tiny, non-resizable message boxes. (Bug #3441535, Dale Anson)
