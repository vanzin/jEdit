  to the Launcher and then run it, a separate icon for the running instance is
  shown. With this change this is correctly merged with the pinned starter.

{{{ API changes

- API made public:
  org.gjt.sp.jedit.browser.VFSFileNameField (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added methods to manage the cursor if the TextArea :
  In the TextAreaPainter class, added
  resetCursor()
  setCursor(Cursor)
  The cursor behavior is the following :
  when the cursor is the default one : TEXT_CURSOR,
  when typing text it is hidden, after moving the mouse it reappears.
  If a plugin calls setCursor() to replace it for whatever reason,
  the cursor will not disappear anymore when typing or be changed to
  TEXT_CURSOR until resetCursor() is called (Matthieu Casanova)

- Introduction of a new ThreadUtilities class implementing a
  threadpool using Java 1.6 Concurrent API. Use this instead of
  VFSManager's WorkThreadPool, which is now deprecated.
  Related: A new Task Monitor dockable which will eventually replace
  the I/O progress monitor, for showing progress of tasks.
  Still TODO: rewrite VFSManager + all plugins to use ThreadUtilities
  instead of WorkThreadPool. (Matthieu Casanova)

- Made method TextUtilities.getCharType() public (Matthieu Casanova)

- Status bar widget : it is now possible to use labels starting with letters
  in status bar. (Matthieu Casanova)

- Removed long deprecated TextArea#isDragInProgress() and
  TextArea#setDragInProgress(). (SF.net patch #2809776,2936146 - Kevin Hunter)

- EditBus.send() will now always deliver messages on the AWT thread, although
  it can be called from any thread. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added EditBus.sendAsync(): this just enqueues messages to be send over
  the EditBus as soon as the AWT thread is not busy, and returns immediately.
  (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added ability to tag classes with EditBus.EBHandler. This is only useful
  when tagging an EditPlugin class, and makes the plugin instance behave
  as if it implemented EBComponent (it's added to the bus when the plugin
  is activated). (Marcelo Vanzin)

- RFC edit mode was misplaced in catalog and was never matching anything because
  text edit mode glob was more global and checked first (Matthieu Casanova)

  (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added actions for eating whitespace at word ends in both directions
  for findWordStart. (#1953341 - strank)

  used for the selection foreground instead of the syntax highlighting color.
  The new option can be set from Global Options -> Text Area.

- Fixed ModeCatalogHandler so if an edit mode in the user-specific catalog has
