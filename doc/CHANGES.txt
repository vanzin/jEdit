JEDIT 3.2 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 3.2.2

+ New Features

- JHTML syntax highlighting (Will Sargent)
- RelationalView syntax highlighting (Will Sargent)
- clipboardHangWorkaround.bsh startup script included. If your JVM
  hangs when jEdit tries to copy or paste, take a look at this script.

+ Enhancements

- Eliminated delay when showing check box menu items for the first time
- JARClassLoader is much faster now
- BeanShell performance tweak: loaded classes are cached in the
  namespace which contained the 'import' that resolved them
- BeanShell performance tweak: default imports (java.lang, java.awt,
  etc) are only loaded into the top-level namespace, and due to the
  above change, classes found in the default imported packages are
  cached and only ever have to be searched for once
- New version of jEditLauncher (John Gellene)
  - Whan user elects to retain command line parameters, an upgrade
    always updates path to jar file.
  - Location of server file set from -user.home value defined on
    command line if jEdit -settings parameter is not used.
  - Eliminates dependence on Windows Sockets 2.0; version 1.1 is
    sufficient.
  - Installer module now writes detailed log to install.log in jEdit
    installation directory.

+ Bug Fixes

- 'Welcome' link in help didn't work
- Fixed another grab key dialog box bug
- Fixed minor slowdown when making changes in the first or last three
  lines of a buffer
- On Windows, javax.swing.filechooser.FileSystemView.isHiddenFile()
  always returns false. So now we attempt calling the File.isHidden()
  method via reflection to find out if a file is hidden or not.
- File permissions were not preserved on MacOS X, because FileVFS did
  not detect if it was running on MacOS X properly
- 'Stop' button in plugin list download progress should now work under
  all Java versions

+ API Changes

- New MiscUtilities.isToolsJarAvailable() method, attempts to load the
  JDK tools.jar, returns true if successful (Dirk Moebius)

* Version 3.2.1

+ New Features

- 'Color Picker' macro added
- Objective-C syntax highlighting (Kris Kopicki)

+ Enhancements

- Updated PV-WAVE edit mode (Ed Stewart)
- Updated 'Write HyperSearch Results' macro (John Gellene)
- Updated jEditLauncher (John Gellene)

+ Bug Fixes

- Clicks in table of contents in help viewer didn't work
- A few actions didn't record a trailing ; when recording a macro
- Fixed another BeanShell performance problem
- Fixed a few minor problems if a plugin threw an exception in its
  start() method (Dirk Moebius)
- MRJ on MacOS 8/9 returns an os.name of "Mac OS", but jEdit was
  checking for "MacOS".
- Fixed minor grab key dialog box bug

+ API Changes

- View.getToolBar() method added
- Status bar change necessary for upcoming Vimulator plugin (Mike Dillon)

* Version 3.2final

+ Enhancements

- Improvements to plugin resource handling, needed by XML plugin 0.4
- Changes to BeanShellAction to improve performance
- jedit.spec file for creating RPM improved (Mike Dillon)
- Documentation changes (John Gellene)
- jEditLauncher updates (John Gellene)

+ Bug Fixes

- Removed debug message from JEditTextArea.java
- 'Go to Previous Bracket' command didn't work

* Version 3.2pre10

+ New Features

- PL-SQL syntax highlighting (Rick Owen)

+ Enhancements

- Documentation updates
- The jedit.spec file for creating the Linux RPM package can now be used
  to compile and build jEdit from scratch
- Improved RPM spec syntax highlighting
- Read-only flag is automatically set when loading files from read-only
  filesystems, like the Archive plugin VFS
- Improved JSP syntax highlighting (Daiji Takamori)
- Nicer looking history text fields (Dirk Moebius)
- C+Home and C+End no longer deactivate selections in multiple selection
  mode

+ Bug Fixes

- C+. and C+, bug fix, again
- Help viewer tree would showed tooltips in wrong place
- Replacing text with multiple selections active caused the text to be
  inserted in the wrong place
- Reverse search didn't work sometimes
- AltGR key works on JDK 1.4 again
- The plugin manager now only uses the first three characters of the
  java.version property when checking plugin dependencies. This solves
  the problem of the WheelMouse plugin not appearing on JDK 1.3.1, because
  one version was listed as needing Java >= 1.2, <= 1.3, and the other
  needing Java >= 1.4.

+ API Changes

- BeanShell.eval() no longer creates a new namespace
- jEdit.openFile(View,String,String,boolean,boolean) deprecated
  jEdit.openFile(View,String,String,boolean,boolean,Hashtable) depreacted
  The 'readOnly' parameter should no longer be specified. Use
  jEdit.openFile(View,String,String,boolean,Hashtable) instead.
- Most plugins probably use openFile(View,String), which is still the
  same as ever.
- jEdit.addPluginJAR() is now public, for plugins that want to load the
  JDK's tools.jar or whatever
- EditPlugin.JAR constructor is now public, for the same reason as above

* Version 3.2pre9

+ New Features

- Keys can now be bound to letter keys without modifiers; eg you can
  bind a macro to '>' that in HTML mode inserts the appropriate closing
  tag automatically. Note that the actual character is not inserted, so
  the macro would need to insert '>' first itself.
- 'Make Bug Report' macro (John Gellene)

+ Enhancements

- Documentation updates
- Improved Python syntax highlighting (Ollie Rutherfurd)

+ Bug Fixes

- Fixed a few bugs in the shortcuts option pane (Dirk Moebius)
- Fixed typo in a tip of the day
- If the text area was too small, it would report a negative number of
  visible lines, which caused problems
- Disabled non-working persistent splits feature, which could have
  caused problems
- Invoking menus using Alt-key mnemonics would insert the mnemonic
  character into the buffer on JDK 1.4
- Fixed long-standing bug in scroll-to-caret code
- C+. and C+, didn't set the history model of the search bar
- Possible fix for jEdit hanging on JDK 1.4 when file modified on disk
  by another program

+ API Changes

- FileVFS.getPermissions() and setPermissions() methods get and set file
  permissions on Unix. These methods were formely private, now they are
  public and static. They do nothing if jEdit is not being run on a Unix
  platform.
- Minor change to marker behavior to facilitate AStyle and JavaStyle
  plugins (Dirk Moebius)
- JCheckBoxList class moved to org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui package

* Version 3.2pre8

+ New Features

- PV-WAVE syntax highlighting (Ed Stewart)

+ Enhancements

- Improved XSL abbrevs (Ollie Rutherfurd)
- jEditLauncher updates (John Gellene)
- Updated Duplicate_Line and Next_Char macros (John Gellene)
- Improved shortcuts option pane (Dirk Moebius)
- Improved PHP mode
- Middle mouse button paste can now be disabled in the Global Options
  dialog box

+ Neutral

- Only selections created with the mouse are stored in the % register

+ Bug Fixes

- Right mouse button clicks didn't work on all platforms
- Printing didn't work due to a change in 3.2pre7
- Fixed exception printed when trying to use the file chooser dialog box
- jEditLauncher didn't work due to an EditServer change in pre7
- jEdit might hang if an error was shown while downloading the plugin
  list in the plugin manager

* Version 3.2pre7

+ New Features

- BeanShell 1.2beta1 included
- When running on Unix with Java 2 version 1.4, clicking the middle
  mouse button in the text area now pastes the primary selection. This
  obsoletes the XClipboard plugin
- Visual Foxpro syntax highlighting (Matt Price)
- SQR syntax highlighting (Richard Ashwell)
- Cruddy -bshclient command-line switch replaced with -run=<script>
  parameter; it will run the specified script file, and works in both
  the initial and client instances of jEdit.
  - The script is run in the global namespace, so variables and
    functions defined within will be available for the rest of the
    editing session. Just like a startup script.
  - The 'view', 'buffer', 'editPane' and 'textArea' variables are not
    set in this script; if it is being run at startup, it will also be
    run before the first view is even initialized. Just like a startup
    script
- Just for fun, a sample startup script, named changeUIFonts.bsh is
  included. This is an undocumented feature and will be replaced with
  a setting in the global options dialog box in the next major release.

+ Enhancements

- Improved jEditLauncher (John Gellene):
   - executes scripts and runs JDiff from Windows shell menu or from
     scripting interface.
   - launcher waits for extended timeout period for jEdit to load.
   - multiple requests to run jEdit, launch files or run scripts are
     queued by the launcher while jEdit is loading.
   - javaw.exe is default interpreter for launching, subject to change
     by configuation utility.
   - automatic reboot when installation replaces in-memory modules.
   - fixes for all reported bugs.
- Improved PHP syntax highlighting (Ben Sarsgard)
- Minor change to plugin manager error reporting
- Console_Plugin macros removed, Console 3.0 incorporates all relevant
  features
- Transient status messages (replace all results, for example) are now
  shown for 10 seconds, instead of 2
- Updated 'Writing Plugins' section of user's guide (John Gellene)
- isPopupTrigger() is now used, instead of explicitly checking for
  Button 3 being pressed. This change was because on the Mac,
  Control-clicking is used to simulate a right mouse button click.
- History text fields previously used a Control click to display a menu
  of completions; this has been changed to a Shift click
- To be consistent with the above change, the search up and search down
  shortcuts in history text fields have been changed from C+Up and
  C+Down to S+Up and S+Down
- You can now press Enter in the 'Directory' and 'Filter' fields of the
  search and replace dialog box to begin a search
- Clicking on the mode and encoding display in the status bar opens the
  Buffer Options dialog box, clicking the overwrite and multiple
  selection display toggles those settings
- When running on Unix with Java 2, the installer writes a shorter shell
  script that uses the -jar command line switch, instead of setting the
  class path
- -newview command line switch is now a property that can be set in the
  Loading and Saving pane of the Global Options dialog box
- New method for use in macros:
  SearchAndReplace.replace(View view, Buffer buffer, int start, int end)

+ Bug Fixes

- Help viewer will no longer print an exception if the toc.xml file
  could not be found
- Token backgrounds were not being drawn
- Trying to print threw an exception with Java 2. This has been fixed,
  but the other problems with printing on Java 2, such as huge spool
  files being created, remain.
- GrabKeyDialog bug fix for JDK 1.4 (Alan Moore)
- roots: virtual filesystem didn't list all filesystem roots on JDK 1.4
- Possible workaround for window positioning bugs on Unix with KDE 2
- jEditLauncher used a Windows API call only available on Windows 98 and
  2000
- All files in the search set would be listed in the HyperSearch results
  window, even files which do not contain the search string
- AltGR key didn't work with Java 2 version 1.4 (Vicente Salvador)
- Global options dialog box looked a bit dodgy with the 'global colors'
  setting
- Could paste into read-only buffers
- Commands which used readNextChar() were not recorded properly
- The grab key dialog box would record the Control and Command keys
  swapped on MacOS
- PHP mode was missing a SEQ rule for '=', so sequences like $var=TRUE
  would be highlighted incorrectly
- Deleted files no longer become read only
- INVALID token type could not be used in edit mode definitions
- jEdit wouldn't ask for confirmation when saving over an existing file
  in some circumstances
- 'OS/2 startup script' fileset was never shown in the installer on OS/2

* Version 3.2pre6

+ New Features

- jEditLauncher is a Windows native launcher for jEdit. It has an
  EditServer client written in native code for improved performance,
  and adds a command for starting jEdit to the Windows Explorer
  right-click menu (John Gellene)
- When running on Java 2, anti-aliasing can be enabled in the Text
  Area pane of Global Options dialog box. Replaces AntiAlias plugin,
  and works better, because Java2D text measurement code is used to
  calculate offsets
- Progress 4GL syntax highlighting (Patrick Tingen)

+ Enhancements

- PHP mode now highlights variables in string literals
- Repeating an action more than 20 times displayed a confirmation
  dialog, but character input could be repeated any number of times.
  Now, a confirmation dialog is displayed for large character inputs
  too.
- Documentation updates
- Updated set of sample macros (John Gellene)
- More XSL abbreviation updates (Ollie Rutherfurd)
- The functionality of the following macros has been moved to the
  corresponding plugins:
  - Go_to_Clipper (to Clipper plugin)
  - Go_to_Console (to Console plugin)
  - Show_Dual_Diff (to JDiff plugin)
- The Replace All command now shows the replacement results in the
  status bar, not in a dialog box
- The HyperSearch command now shows the number of matches found in the
  HyperSearch Results window, not in a dialog box
- The 'Reload' and 'Reload All Buffers' commands now save the caret
  position

+ Bug Fixes

- README.txt, CHANGES.txt, etc. were missing from jedit.jar
- Setting the file system browser's default path to 'favorites' didn't
  work
- In an abbrev expansion, $$1 will now be replaced by a dollar, followed
  by the value of the first positional parameter. Previously, the first
  dollar sign would cause problems
- 'Quick HyperSearch' command didn't work
- When running on Java 2, jEdit uses Java2D text rendering and
  measurement code. This should finally fix the 'caret drawn in wrong
  place' bug, even when anti-aliasing is enabled
- jEdit.openFiles() didn't setBuffer(), so when jEdit connected to
  another instance, the new instance opened the necessary files, but
  never displayed them
- 'Default edit mode' setting didn't work

* Version 3.2pre5

+ New Features

- BeanShell 1.1a18:
  - Better error reporting
  - Cleaned up internals
  - Performance improvements
  - You can now access JavaBeans properties using bean.prop or
    bean{"prop"} syntax
  - 'import' statements can be used in any block scope, not just top
    level. This means you can have import statements in actions.xml, for
    example.
  - Some jEdit code dealing with BeanShell has been cleaned up
- The three sample 'Hello' plugins included with the source download
  have been replaced with a single, more comprehensive demonstration
  plugin written by John Gellene named 'QuickNotepad'
- Omnimark syntax highlighting (Lionel Fiol)
- Velocity syntax highlighting (Saimon Moore)

+ Enhancements

- Updated XSL mode (Ollie Rutherfurd)
- A set of XSL abbreviations is now included in the default abbreviation
  set
- The 'Update Plugins' dialog box now deletes obsolete plugins
- Minor improvement to Javadoc highlighting in Java source
- Improved 'BeanShell Error' dialog box
- Text fields no longer get the text area font
- 'Add Marker' and 'Remove Marker from Current Line' commands merged
  into an 'Add/Remove Marker' command that toggles the marker on the
  current line
- 'Search and Replace' dialog box has a new look
- If auto wrap around is enabled, a message will be shown in the status
  bar when the search is restarted
- The shortcut to toggle multiple selection has been changed from
  Caps Lock to C+\
- The HyperSearch settings in the search bar is now independent of the
  HyperSearch setting in the search and replace dialog box
- Documentation updates

+ Bug Fixes

- The -version and -usage command line parameters produced no output
- The 'caret not being drawn in the right place' but that occured with
  certain Java versions should now be fixed, because of the following
  two bug fixes:
  - SyntaxStyle.getFontMetrics() didn't call deriveFont() on Java 2
  - jEdit now uses Component.getFontMetrics() instead of
    Toolkit.getFontMetrics() throughout
- Opening a recent file could create a pseudo-random selection, due to a
  bug in the recent file handler
- Replace all was a bit buggy
- Ruby mode filename extension was wrong
- Fixed typo in one of the tips of the day
- The local file VFS now displays an error message if a directory could
  not be listed, instead of silently failing
- Manipulating markers will no longer set the 'dirty' flag if the
  persistent markers feature is disabled
- Fixed another recent file list bug
- 'Paste' command displayed a cryptic exception if the buffer was read
  only. Now it just beeps
- jEdit ran startup scripts in the settings directory twice, and startup
  scripts in the jEdit home directory weren't being run at all
- JEditTextArea._addToSelection() method didn't merge selections
  properly, as a result triple-clicks to select lines didn't work too
  well
- When adding or removing a marker, the 'dirty' flag would be set
  if persistent markers were enabled, and would not be set otherwise.
  This is the opposite of the correct behavior.

+ API Changes

- GUIUtilities.loadMenu(view,name) deprecated; use loadMenu(name)
  instead
- The Console plugin's "BeanShell" shell was broken by an API change.
  The upcoming version 3.0 of the Console plugin will fix the problem.

* Version 3.2pre4

+ New Features

- Improved support for editing files with different character encodings:
  - The encoding used to load a file is remembered in the buffer history
  - File->Open With Encoding menu
  - Encoding can be changed for open buffers in Utilities->Buffer
    Options
  - Editor default can be changed in Utilities->Global Options->Loading
    and saving
  - In stand-alone file system browser, an 'Open With Encoding' submenu
    appears in the right-click context menu
- Occam syntax highlighting (Richard Beton)
- MIPS R2000 assembly syntax highlighting (Marc Rummel)
- The icons in the file system browser can be toggled on and off
- A dialog box is now displayed after a HyperSearch has been performed,
  showing the number of results found
- 'Toggle Line Comment' macro (John Gellene)
- Swing text fields and text areas now have the same font as the text
  area
- gnu.regexp 1.1.3 bundled. Positive lookaheads (?=...) and negative
  lookaheads (?!=...) are now supported
- Non-working 'narrow' indicator in status has been replaced with a
  working 'fold' indicator that is on if portions of the buffer are
  hidden from view
- Experimental option to use jEdit text area colors in all text
  components. It doesn't work too well yet; see the to do list for a
  list of known issues
- Startup macro feature replaced with startup scripts, which must have
  a .bsh extension and can be put in the 'startup' subdirectory of the
  user settings or jEdit home directories
- The EditServer can now run arbitriary BeanShell code sent by clients.
  Note that an authorization key is still required so this is not a
  security risk. jEditLauncher, jEditOpener and other code that
  interfaces with the edit server will need to be updated.
- Running jEdit with the -bshclient switch will read a BeanShell script
  from standard input and send it to an already running instance of
  jEdit for evaluation.
- The feature to fully parse files for syntax information when loading
  has been added again

+ Enhancements

- You can now choose if you want to download plugin source, or only
  binaries
- NEWS.txt written
- Updated macro guide (John Gellene)
- SGML documentation has been converted to XML. You now need the
  DocBook-XML 4.1.2 DTD to parse it
- Source code for three sample plugins now included with the jEdit
  source download
- Updated set of sample macros (John Gellene)
- Improved XML and XSL modes (Ollie Rutherfurd)
- The edit server now explicitly uses the UTF8 encoding when reading
  and writing from/to the socket, instead of using the JVM default
- Improved reporting of I/O errors throughout the editor
- The buffer history (formely $HOME/.jedit/recent) is now written to
  $HOME/.jedit/recent.xml, as XML
- Minor improvement to magic caret code

+ Bug Fixes

- Searching for certain regular expressions (like (), ^, or $ by itself,
  etc) would hang jEdit
- Some of the links in the help viewer table of contents didn't work
- Tab key didn't work in Java 1.4
- jEdit would throw an exception upon loading a buffer if the first line
  had a leading indent and an initial fold level was specified
- Possible fix for Tab key and C+i not working with some Java versions
  in 'grab key' dialog box used by shortcut option panes
- Double-clicks to select bracketed blocks now work better
- If jEdit was running in background mode and a client instance was
  started with the -norestore switch, a NullPointerException could be
  printed
- A few bugs that could occur with obscure combinations of command-line
  parameters have been fixed. A side-effect of this is that the -nogui
  command line switch is no longer available.
- The default size of the file system browser was wrong
- Fixed edit server bug that occured on some systems (probably only
  Windows?) (John Gellene)
- Both 'Browse System Macros' and 'Browse User Macros' commands opened
  the user macro directory (Ollie Rutherfurd)
- Errors connecting to the server were never written to the activity.log
  file, nor were they written to standard output, even if the default
  log level was changed
- Dollar signs followed by a non-digit character would disappear without
  trace when the abbrev is expanded. Now, they are left as-is unless a
  digit follows
- Setting the CARET property by passing a Hashtable to the openFile()
  method should now work even if the buffer is already open.

+ API Changes

- New method: BeanShell.runScript(View, String path, Reader in, boolean,
  boolean); like the other form of runScript() but reads the script from
  the Reader and only uses the path for error reporting purposes. This
  means plugins can load arbitriary code on startup. Console 3.0 uses
  this.
- The runCommandInConsole() method has been moved from the 'Console
  Plugin' macros to the Console plugin itself. Install Console 3.0 or
  later for these macros to work.

* Version 3.2pre3

+ New Features

- 'Include Guard' macro (John Gellene)
- Positional parameters in abbrevs: if you enter something like, for
  example, F#j#array.length# in Java mode where 'F' is defined to
  expand to 'for(int $1 = 0; $1 < $2; $1++)\n{\n\t\|\n}', the following
  will be inserted in the buffer, with the caret positioned between the
  two curly braces:

  for(int j = 0; j < array.length; j++)
  {

  }

+ Enhancements

- Improved progress bar window in plugin manager
- Specifying a repeat count greater than 20 displays a confirmation
  dialog box
- C+ENTER displays a prompt now
- On MacOS X, jEdit's menus are now placed into the system menu bar,
  not in a fake 'menu bar' inside views
- Status bar has a new look
- jEdit no longer uses hard-coded fonts for the buffer switcher, search
  bar and status bar
- -nosplash command line switch removed, splash screen can now be
  enabled and disabled in the Utilities->Global Options dialog box
- Expanding a fold will now attempt to scroll the text area in order to
  make the fold visible, if possible
- The current buffer's edit mode is now shown in the status bar
- Java mode has a new set of default abbrevs

+ Neutral

- User's guide has been moved into the jedit.jar JAR file

+ Bug Fixes

- plugins.dtd was missing from jedit.jar, thus the new plugin manager
  didn't work
- FileVFS._rename() didn't work if the destination file already exists
  on Windows. This caused problems when saving files, for example,
  because #<filename>#save# would never be renamed to <filename>
- Fixed several bugs in the 'scroll to caret' code
- Keyboard shortcuts might work in Java 1.4 now
- The recent file list was being reversed each time jEdit was run!!!
- Improved handling of 'Stop' button in plugin manager progress dialog
  boxes
- Modes in the system mode directory no longer always shadow the modes
  in the user specific mode directory
- Fixed obscure bug in Buffer.addToMap() that could result in an invalid
  line map when expading certain folds
- Slightly faster regular expression search

* Version 3.2pre2

+ New Features

- New plugin manager. The major changes are:
  - Now part of the jEdit core, not a plugin
  - Uses new server-side backend, courtesy of Mike Dillon
  - Removing a plugin consisting of multiple JARs (Archive, JavaInsight)
    removes all JARs, not just the main one
  - Dependencies are now resolved automatically, eg installing the
    JCompiler plugin will automatically install or update, if necessary,
    the EditBus, ErrorList and Console plugins
  - Many parts of the code have been rewritten from scratch and as a
    result it is much cleaner
- This was actually added in 3.2pre1, not 3.2pre2, but I forgot to
  mention it to the change log. 'BeanShell search and replace' lets you
  replace occurences of a search string (or regexp) with the result of a
  BeanShell code snippet. For example, you can use it to convert all
  tags in an HTML file to lower case.
- Verilog syntax highlighting (Wojciech Stryjewski)
- Utilities->Reload Edit Modes command
- 'Search in Directory' command added to file system browser right click
  menu
- Views once again have a status bar which displays caret position info,
  prompts issued by register and marker commands, I/O status, and so on.
  The status bar now displays caret location information in the same
  style as VI, courtesy of Mike Dillon

+ Enhancements

- The current selection state is preserved in the buffer history (along
  with the caret position)
- Improved PHP syntax highlighting (Daniel Beckham)
- Files are now saved to #<filename>#save#, then renamed to <filename>.
  This prevents data loss if, for example, the disk is full or jEdit
  crashes while saving.
- Search->Find always selects current buffer set.
  Search->Search in Open Buffers (C+e C+b) selects 'All Buffers' file set.
  Search->Search in Directory (C+e C+d) selects 'Directory' file set
- 'Search Buffer' and 'Search Directory Tree' macros removed
- The File->Recent Files menu no longer displays path names, due to a
  Swing bug that would display the menu in the wrong place if it was too
  long. If you want to find out the full path name, move the mouse over
  the relevant menu item, and the full path will be shown in the status
  bar.
- jEdit now restore previously open files on startup, even if file names
  were specifed on the command line. This can be disabled in
  Utilities->Global Options->Loading and Saving
- The 'Escape' key can now be used in the 'Add Abbreviation' dialog box
- On MacOS and MacOS X, the primary modifier is Command, not Control now
- The activity log is now dockable

+ Neutral

- Modes no longer define a 'boxComment' property
- 'Delete Marker at Caret' macro removed because the 'Remove Marker from
  Current Line' command does the same thing

+ Bug Fixes

- Fixed a compile error with Java 1.3
- 'Line Comment' threw an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception
- jEdit formely cached the find dialog for each view after it had been
  displayed once, reusing the dialog box subsequent times. However, some
  Java versions seem to have rather buggy code for showing and hiding
  windows. So this feature has been removed.
- Current line highlight was not painted in the gutter
- Plugin shortcuts didn't work due to a change in 3.2pre1
- Ugly workaround for the bug where BeanShell would barf if a script did
  not end with a newline
- JSP mode now highlights JSP comments correctly (<%-- ... --%>)
- New files can now be reloaded
- Fixed minor gutter mouse bug
- Edit->Select None didn't work at all
- Fixed minor bug in prev-char and next-char commands with multiple
  selections
- InputHandler.readNextChar() now substitutes every occurrence of
  "__char__" with the typed character. Previously, it only substituted
  the first occurrence
- The edit server was supposed to bind to 127.0.0.1, but instead it
  bound to the machine's network address
- Possible fix for the NullPointerException some people have experienced
  with the tip of the day dialog box
- Moving the mouse into the gutter while a buffer containing markers
  was being loaded would throw a NullPointerException
- Fixed bogus "The url filesystem does not support directory browsing"
  error message displayed when loading http:// URLs
- An exception would be printed if the 'BeanShell' radio button was
  selected in the search and replace dialog box, but nothing was entered
  in the text field
- CS+DOWN (select next paragraph) didn't work properly
- print() in BeanShell didn't work for non-string arguments
- jEdit will no longer attempt to recover an autosave file that you do
  not have read access for

+ API Changes

- SearchAndReplace.showSearchDialog() method removed. Simply create a
  new SearchDialog instance instead
- InputHandler.readNextChar(String code) deprecated. Use the new form
  instead:

  readNextChar(String prompt, String code).

  'prompt' will be shown in the status bar.
- JEditTextArea.isSelectionRectangular() method was removed in 3.2pre1,
  but I have added it again (marking it deprecated) so that JDiff can
  continue working until it is updated for the new API.

* Version 3.2pre1

+ New Features

- Pressing Caps Lock toggles multiple selection on and off. In multiple
  selection mode, any number of chunks can be selected, and the caret
  position is independent of the selection. All jEdit built-in commands
  support multiple selections. If they don't, it's a bug
- Caret registers and markers merged:
  - 'Markers' top level menu contains commands for manipulating markers.
  - Markers can no longer be named -- the menu just shows the line of
    text containing the marker, along with the line number.
  - Markers can have single-character 'shortcuts'. To add a marker with
    a shortcut, use the 'Add Marker With Shortcut' command.
  - Key strokes for dealing with markers with shortcuts are the same as
    the old register command keystrokes (C+t, C+y, C+u, C+k)
  - Unlike caret registers, which were global to the editor, markers are
    buffer-specific.
  - Registers are now only used to store text.
  - Note that adding a marker with a shortcut of an existing one does
    not delete the existing marker, it merely clears its shortcut.
  - Registers and marker shortcuts are stored in a different namespace,
    so you can have text in register 'a' and a marker with shortcut 'a'
    at the same time
- X-Windows style copy and paste now supported: most recently selected
  text is stored in the '%' register, middle mouse button click (or
  Alt-click if you only have a 2 button mouse) inserts contents of that
  register.
- New 'Copy Append' (C+e C+a), 'Cut Append' (C+e C+u) commands append
  selected text to clipboard.
- New 'Cut Append to Register' (C+r C+u) command append selected text to
  specified register and removes it from the buffer.

+ Enhancements

- 'Auto wrap around' option in search and replace dialog box
- Edit server now binds to local host only (so that remote attackers
  can't compromise jEdit) and accepts no more than 2 simultaneous
  connection attempts (Mike Dillon)
- The 'Run Other Macro' command no longer uses the obsolete Swing file
  chooser dialog box
- Marker saving can now be toggled in Utilities->Global Options->Loading
  and Saving
- View->Scrolling->Scroll to Caret (C+e C+j) now expands the fold
  containing the caret, if necessary
- -nostartupmacro command line switch
- Improved 'View Registers' dialog box
- The gutter now shows marker tooltips immediately
- Installer has a new look
- Installer now installs jedit.cmd file for starting jEdit on OS/2

+ Neutral

- 'Append to Register' command renamed 'Copy Append to Register'
- 'Replace All' no longer bound to C+e C+a
- 'site-props' directory renamed to 'properties'
- 'Rectangular Selection' command removed. Now, the only way to create
  a rectangular selection is to either Control-drag or
  Control-Shift-click
- 'Box Comment' command removed (it might reappear later. I just can't
  be bothered updating it for the new selection code right now.)
- 'Wing Comment' renamed 'Range Comment', 'Block Comment' renamed 'Line
  Comment'
- Startup macro is now run before the first view is created (so the
  Swing font hack script floating around can now work without the
  view.splitVertically()/view.unsplit() hackery)

+ Bug Fixes

- print() should now work in BeanShell:
  - if invoked from Console plugin, prints output to console
  - otherwise, prints the specified string to the activity log, with log
    level 'warning' (so that it is also printed to the standard error
    stream)
- If a view was split and several buffers were visible, only one of them
  would be checked when the view gains focus for modification by another
  program
- The setting of the reverse search flag wasn't fully saved and restored
- The setting of the HyperSearch flag wasn't handled properly by the
  search bar
- Notepad macro threw an exception when its window was closed
- The 'Search in Current Buffer' and 'Search in Directory' macros didn't
  work
- If the caret was at the beginning of the line, prev-word would move it
  to the beginning of the previous line, not the end of the previous
  line as you would expect
- Fixed possible NPE when closing files due to jEdit.removeBufferFromList()
  being called twice

+ API Changes

- As jEdit now handles middle mouse button clicks itself, the XClipboard
  plugin will have to be modified to set a custom implementation of the
  '%' register, instead of trapping middle mouse clicks directly.
- Plugins are now loaded after the buffer history and macros are
  initialised
- org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.RegistersChanged message removed
- Old text selection methods in JEditTextArea deprecated:
  getSelectionStart()
  getSelectionEnd()
  getSelectionStartLine()
  getSelectionEndLine()
  getMarkPosition()
  getMarkLine()
  select()

- New text selection API:
  Selection[] getSelection()
  setSelection(Selection[] selection)
  setSelection(Selection selection)
  addToSelection(Selection[] selection)
  addToSelection(Selection selection)
  removeFromSelection(Selection selection)
  getSelectionAtOffset(int offset)
  getSelectedText(Selection s)
  setSelectedText(Selection s, String text)
  getSelectedText(String separator) (returns all selections, separated
    by the separator string)
  getSelectedText() (returns all selections, separated by newlines)
  moveCaretPosition() (moves caret without affecting selection)
  setCaretPosition() (deactivates selection and moves caret)
  resizeSelection(int offset, int end) (resizes the selection at
    'offset' to 'end')
  extendSelection(int offset, int end) (adds a selection spanning
    'offset' to 'end', performing various tricks if there already is a
    selection at 'offset')

  org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.Selection is an abstract class. The two
  concrete implementations are Selection.Range and Selection.Rect.
  
  Methods in Selection class:
  Selection() (empty constructor)
  Selection(Selection sel) (copy start/end from this selection)
  Selection(int start, int end)
  int getStart()
  int getEnd()
  int getStartLine()
  int getEndLine()
  int getStart(Buffer buffer, int line) (only useful with Selection.Rect)
  int getEnd(Buffer buffer, int line) (ditto)
