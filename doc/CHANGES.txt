{{{ Bug fixes

- The mirror "Plugin Central default" now works as auto selecting
  mirror and is used by default. Previous default was hardcoded "switch"
  (mirror.switch.ch) as workaround, but one could easily stuck on broken
  "Plugin Central default" and got strange errors.
  (#2913393, #3501210 - Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Avoided annoying behavior of electric keys that canceled obvious
  manual indentation. Now they take effect only when the current level
  of indentation is same with automatic indentation.
  (#1936678, #2332140 Jarek Czekalski, Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Fixed "Backup on every save" resets file permissions. Renaming of the file
  was replaced with copying. (#1803073 Jarek Czekalski)

- Added backup of remote files, for example opened with FTP plugin.
  (#1525654 Jarek Czekalski)

- Fixed NPE which was shown in place of a proper error message for empty
  keyword elements in mode XML. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

- Cannot DnD betweeen PingPongLists (#3501020 Jarek Czekalski)

- Fixed macros at menu split are unaccessible (#3512853 Jarek Czekalski)

- If the same plugin is installed in home and install folder, only the newest
  is loaded. (#1848802 Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed rectangular selection constructor (patch #3440310 peibl)

- When copying a file in VFSBrowser, if a file with the same name already exists
  a suffix copy-n is added to avoid deleting the existing file
  (#3470759 Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed Ctrl + key not working in completion popup (Matthieu Casanova)

- Fixed copy of Hypersearch results adding \r in the clipboard
  (#3142456 Matthieu Casanova)

- The Java based installer now correctly handles GNU style long filenames in
  the installer package and thus does not corrupt the JavaDoc files anymore
  (#2327520 Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Several message boxes were not being created on the EDT which would result in
  tiny, non-resizable message boxes. (#3441535 Dale Anson)

{{{ API Changes

- Implemented comparable in JEditBuffer and Buffer, to allow for
  resource ordering. (Jarek Czekalski)

- New method Debug.compDelay, for debugging purposes (Jarek Czekalski)

- Made EditBus.send uninterruptible, as it was before putting handling of
  messages into EDT (r17139, to 4.4).

- New method ThreadUtilities.runInDispatchThreadNow() (Jarek Czekalski)

- New VFS capability: NON_AWT_SESSION_CAP and a helper method
  VFS.createVFSSessionSafe that frees the caller from entering the EDT
  thread in most cases. All built-in filesystems have this capability set.
  (Jarek Czekalski)

- The status bar widget service is now
  org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.statusbar.StatusWidgetFactory instead of
  org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.statusbar.StatusWidget (only the name in service.xml)
  is modified, because the service class is a StatusWidgetFactory and not a
  StatusWidget (#3521413 Matthieu Casanova)

- New public constructor for org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.ErrorListDialog
  allowing for specifying custom urgency (priority). (Jarek Czekalski)

- TextArea.isCaretVisible became public (patch #3518424 Makarius)

- Fixed jedit exit procedure. Now all views are closed. Earlier only
  the current view was properly closed. This may be important for plugins
  that were workarounding the issue, as now they will get more
  ViewUpdate.CLOSED messages. (Jarek Czekalski)

- The JEditEmbeddedTextArea and StandaloneTextArea do not create an empty
  popup menu anymore.
  To add a context menu in your JEditEmbeddedTextArea, please override
  createPopupMenu(MouseEvent evt) as before, but also call
  setRightClickPopupEnabled(true) in your constructor (Matthieu Casanova)

- New jEdit.getCurrentLanguage() method that returns the language used  by jEdit
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- New method JEditBuffer.insert(int offset, CharSequence seq) to insert
  text in a buffer. (Matthieu Casanova)

- New constructors for CopyFileWorker:
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, VFSFile[] vfsFiles, String target)
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, VFSFile[] vfsFiles, String target,
  			Behavior behavior)
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, File[] files, String target)
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, File[] files, String target, Behavior behavior)
  to allow copy of multiple files at the same time (Matthieu Casanova)

- New VFS.copy() methods:
  copy(ProgressObserver progress, VFS sourceVFS, Object sourceSession,
  	String sourcePath, VFS targetVFS, Object targetSession,
  	String targetPath, Component comp, boolean canStop,
  	boolean sendVFSUpdate)
  copy(ProgressObserver progress, String sourcePath,String targetPath,
  	Component comp, boolean canStop, boolean sendVFSUpdate)
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- New methods MiscUtilities.getCompleteBaseName() to return
  the (complete) base names of a file (until the last .) and
  and getBaseName(), to replace the badly named getFileNameNoExtension,
  which is now deprecated (Matthieu Casanova, Alan Ezust)

- TextUtilities.join() now accept Collection<?> instead of Collection<String>
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- OperatingSystem.isOS2() method is removed since OS/2 cannot run jEdit since
  many years (Matthieu Casanova)

- OperatingSystem.isDOSDerived() is now deprecated since OS/2 do not exists
  anymore Windows is the only DOS derived OS, so use OperatingSystem.isWindows()
  instead (Matthieu Casanova)

- Some undocumented but public members in class DisplayTokenHandler and
  Chunk became private as they should be in the first place.
    Specifically:
      org.gjt.sp.jedit.syntax.DisplayTokenHandler
        MAX_CHUNK_LEN
        initChunk()  (* this was protected)
      org.gjt.sp.jedit.syntax.Chunk
        accessable
        initialized
        style
        width
        Chunk constructors
        offsetToX() (non static)
        xToOffset() (non static)
        init()
  (Kazutoshi Satoda)
