/**
	TargetError is an EvalError that wraps an exception thrown by the script	
	(or by code called from the script).  TargetErrors indicate exceptions 
	which can be caught within the script itself, whereas a general EvalError 
	indicates that the script cannot be evaluated further for some reason.
	
	If the exception is caught within the script it is automatically unwrapped,
	so the code looks like normal Java code.  If the TargetError is thrown
	from the eval() or interpreter.eval() method it may be caught and unwrapped
	to determine what exception was thrown.
*/
/*
	Implementation note: 
	Although it is easy to catch exceptions generated by called Java code
	and wrap them (e.g. in the method dispatching code), we must be careful 
	do the same with arbitrary exceptions that we generate in interpreted
	code, e.g. ArithmeticException, ClassCastException.

	Also an important location to look at is BSHMethodInvocation.  There
	we catch eval errors and rethrow them to compound the location information
