/**
	BshClassManager manages all classloading in BeanShell.
	It also supports a dynamically loaded extension (bsh.classpath package)
	which allows classpath extension and class file reloading.

	Currently the extension relies on 1.2 for BshClassLoader and weak 
	references.  

	See http://www.beanshell.org/manual/classloading.html for details
	on the bsh classloader architecture.
	<p>

	Bsh has a multi-tiered class loading architecture.  No class loader is
	used unless/until the classpath is modified or a class is reloaded.
	<p>

	Note: currently class loading features affect all instances of the
	Interpreter.  However the basic design of this class will allow for
	per instance class management in the future if it is desired.
*/
/*
	Implementation notes:

	Note: we may need some synchronization in here

	Note on jdk1.2 dependency:
	<p>

	We are forced to use weak references here to accomodate all of the 
	fleeting namespace listeners as they fall out of scope.  (NameSpaces must 
	be informed if the class space changes so that they can un-cache names).  
	I had the thought that a way around this would be to implement BeanShell's 
	own garbage collector...  Then I came to my senses.
	<p>

	Perhaps a simpler idea would be to have entities that reference cached
	types always perform a light weight check with a counter / reference
	value and use that to detect changes in the namespace.  This puts the 
	burden on the consumer to check at appropriate times, but could eliminate
	the need for the listener system in many places and the necessity of weak 
	references in this package.
	<p>
