<html><body>The
<b>View</b>&gt;<b>Folding</b>&gt;<b>Narrow to Selection</b> command hides
all lines except those selected. This can be used to "focus" in on a block
of code by creating a less cluttered display. To
display the entire buffer again, invoke the
<b>View</b>&gt;<b>Folding</b>&gt;<b>Expand All Folds</b> command.
