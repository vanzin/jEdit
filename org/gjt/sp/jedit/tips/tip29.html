<html><body>jEdit supports "folding", or selectively hiding lines based
on their indent level. This can make complex source code much easier
to navigate. To hide and show folds, either click the small squares in
the gutter, or use the commands in the <b>View</b>&gt;<b>Folding</b>
menu.</body></html>
