<html><body>If your computer has a large amount of memory, you can run
jEdit in <i>background mode</i> by passing it the
<code>-background</code> command-line switch. In background mode, jEdit
will stay running and in memory even after all views are closed. This
avoids the startup delay associated with starting jEdit multiple
times.</body></html>
