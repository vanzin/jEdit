Any BeanShell scripts located in the <code>startup</code> subdirectory of the
jEdit home and user settings directories will be run on jEdit startup. Methods
and variables defined in startup scripts are available to all other uses of
BeanShell in jEdit. This is different from macros; methods and variables defined
in macros are lost after the macro finishes executing.
