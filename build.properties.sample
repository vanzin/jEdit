### For generating the docs, adjust the following to your local paths
### Prefer xml over sgml packages if available.
### For xsltproc to work, the path to the DocBook stuff MUST NOT contain spaces!
### If you need multiple catalogs, then use a space as separator

# Example Windows locations
#xsltproc.executable=C:\\Programme\\xsltproc\\xsltproc.exe
#docbook.xsl=C:\\Programme\\DocBook\\XSL\\1.75.2\\
#docbook.catalog=C:\\Programme\\DocBook\\XML\\4.4\\catalog.xml

# Example Cygwin locations
#xsltproc.executable=C:\\cygwin\\usr\\bin\\xsltproc.exe
#docbook.xsl=c:\\cygwin\\usr\\share\\docbook-xsl
#docbook.catalog=c:\\cygwin\\usr\\share\\xml\\docbook\\4.4\\catalog.xml

# Example Debian and Ubuntu locations
#xsltproc.executable=xsltproc
#docbook.xsl=/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl
#docbook.xsl=/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh
#docbook.catalog=/usr/share/xml/docbook/schema/dtd/4.4/catalog.xml

# Example Fedora Core locations
#xsltproc.executable=xsltproc
#docbook.xsl=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets
#docbook.catalog=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.4-1.0-48.fc12/catalog

#fop.dir=/opt/fop-1.0

# Example Debian and Ubuntu location
#fop.dir=/usr/share/java

### For generating the Windows executable file, make sure to install
### Launch4j and set the path to Launch4j install directory here

# Example Windows location
#launch4j.dir=C:\\Programme\\launch4j

# Example Linux location
