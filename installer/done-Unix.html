jEdit has been installed successfully.<p>

To start jEdit, make sure the "shortcut directory" is listed in
your "PATH", and run the <tt>jedit</tt> shell script from the command
line. For example:

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><b>$</b> jedit <i>filename</i> ...</td></tr></table>

You may also want to add this command to your programs menu, create a
launcher icon, or do whatever else to make jEdit accessable from your desktop
environment.
