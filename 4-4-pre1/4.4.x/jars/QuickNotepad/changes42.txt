Changes made to QuickNotepad plugin for jEdit 4.2:

This informs jEdit the plugin is using the new API, and that it should only be
loaded the first time it is accessed by the user.

(4) The QuickNotepad class (the dockable window) implements the new DefaultFocusComponent interface, and the following method was added to this class:

  {
    textArea.requestFocus();
  }
