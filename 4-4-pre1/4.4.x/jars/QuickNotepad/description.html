This plugin provides a dockable "scratch pad" for writing
and displaying notes, to do lists or similar items as unformatted text.
The text is automatically saved upon closing the plugin or exiting
jEdit. It can also be saved manually. The user can change the file to be
displayed during the current editing session. The path of the default
notepad file can be changed as a user option. Finally, the text file can
be copied to a new, untitled jEdit buffer so that it can be edited by the
main program.
