    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para> jEdit 4.4 now requires Java 1.6. </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para> Buffersets have been re-engineered, and simplified. All editpanes
        have the same bufferset scope, so changes to the scope affects all editpanes
        immediately. </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para> Introduction of a new ThreadUtilities class implementing a
        threadpool using Java 1.6 Concurrent API. Use this instead of
        VFSManager's WorkThreadPool, which is now deprecated.
        Related: A new Task Monitor dockable which will eventually replace
        the I/O progress monitor, for showing progress of tasks.
        Still TODO: rewrite VFSManager + all plugins to use ThreadUtilities
        instead of WorkThreadPool.
