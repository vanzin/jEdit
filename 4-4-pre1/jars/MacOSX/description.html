The Mac OS X Support plugin provides features that are specific to Mac OS X
but not supported out-of-the-box by jEdit.

Features include:
* Drag-and-drop support from Finder
* Preferences through conventional CMD+comma and application menu
* Reveal in finder by CMD/CTRL-clicking in the title bar
* Correct mapping of CMD key in all input fields for better copy-paste functionality
