    <para>Several conventions are used throughout jEdit's user interface and
    this manual. They will be described here. Macintosh users should note how

                    <entry>In many dialog boxes, the default button (it has a
                    heavy outline, or a special border, depending on the current
                    Swing look and feel) can be activated by pressing
                    <keycap>Enter</keycap>. Similarly, pressing
                    <keycap>Escape</keycap> will usually close a dialog
                    box.</entry>

                    <entry>Some user interface elements (menus, menu items,
                    buttons) have a certain letter in their label underlined.
                    Pressing this letter in combination with the
                    <keycap>Alt</keycap> key activates the associated user
                    interface widget. Note that this functionality is not
                    available on MacOS X with the <quote>MacOS Adaptive</quote>
                    look and feel. See <xref linkend="appearance-pane" /> for
                    information on changing the look and feel.</entry>

                    <entry>Right mouse button</entry>

                    <entry>Used in jEdit to show context-sensitive menus. If you
                    have a one button Macintosh mouse, a
                    <keycap>Control</keycap>-click has the same effect.</entry>

                <row>
                    <entry>Middle mouse button</entry>

                    <entry>Used by the quick copy feature (see <xref
                    linkend="quick-copy" />). True 3-button mice are rare these
                    days. If you have a wheel mouse, press down on the wheel
                    without rolling it. On a Macintosh with a one-button mouse,
                    <keycap>Option</keycap>-click. On other platforms without a
                    three-button mouse, <keycap>Alt</keycap>-click.</entry>
