    <title>Starting jEdit</title>

    <!-- jEdit buffer-local properties: -->
    <!-- :tabSize=1:indentSize=1:noTabs=true: -->
    <!-- :xml.root=users-guide.xml: -->

    <para>Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system. For
    example, on Unix you can run <quote>jedit</quote> at the command line, or
    select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you can double-click on the jEdit icon
    or select it from the <guimenu>Start</guimenu> menu. </para>

    <para>If jEdit is started while another copy is already running, control is
    transferred to the running copy, and a second instance is not loaded. This
    saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times. Communication
    between instances of jEdit is implemented using TCP/IP sockets; the initial
    instance is known as the <firstterm>server</firstterm>, and subsequent
    invocations are <firstterm>clients</firstterm>.</para>

    <para>If you find yourself launching and exiting jEdit a lot, the startup
    time can get a bit bothersome. If the <userinput>-background</userinput>
    command line switch is specified, jEdit will continue running and waiting
    for client requests even after all editor windows are closed. When run in
    background mode, you can open and close jEdit any number of times, only
    having to wait for it to start the first time. The downside of this is
    increased memory usage.</para>

    <para>When running on MacOS X, the <userinput>-background</userinput>
    command-line switch is active by default, so that jEdit conforms to the
    platform convention that programs should stay open until the
    <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> command is explicitly invoked by the user,
    even if all windows are closed. To disable background mode on MacOS X, use
    the <userinput>-nobackground</userinput> switch.</para>

    <para>For more information about command line switches that control the
    server feature, see <xref linkend="cli-usage" />. </para>

    <para>jEdit remembers open buffers, views and split window configurations
    between editing sessions, so you can get back to work immediately after
    starting jEdit. This feature can be disabled in the
    <guibutton>General</guibutton> pane of the
    <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
    dialog box see <xref linkend="general-pane" />.</para>

    <sidebar>
        <title>The edit server and security</title>

        <para>Since Java does not provide any interprocess communication
        facility other than TCP/IP, jEdit takes extra precautions to prevent
        remote attacks.</para>

        <para>Not only does the edit server pick a random TCP port number on
        startup, it also requires that clients provide an
        <firstterm>authorization key</firstterm>; a randomly-generated number
        only accessible to processes running on the local machine. So not only
        will <quote>bad guys</quote> have to guess a 64-bit integer, they will
        need to get it right on the first try; the edit server shuts itself off
        upon receiving an invalid packet.</para>

        <para>In environments that demand absolute security, the edit server can
        be disabled by specifying the <userinput>-noserver</userinput> command
        line switch.</para>
    </sidebar>

        <title>Command Line Usage</title>

        <para>On operating systems that support a command line, jEdit can be
        passed various arguments to control its behavior.</para>


        <para>When opening files from the command line, a line number or marker
        to position the caret on can be specified like so:</para>

        <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit MyApplet.java +line:10</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit thesis.tex +marker:c</userinput></screen>

        <para>Command-line switches begin with a "-". Some take a parameter. A
        file whose name begins with "-" can be opened like so:</para>

        <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit -- -myfile</userinput></screen>

                            <entry>Keeps the client open until the user closes
                            the specified buffer in the server instance. Does
                            nothing if passed to the initial jEdit instance. Use
                            this switch if jEdit is being invoked by another
                            program as an external editor; otherwise the client
                            will exit immediately and the invoking program will
                            assume you have finished editing the given
                            file.</entry>
